       "['Wow, and wow!  We arrived too late for dinner, but ate off the bar menu which is available until 11pm.  The Kobe Burger and duck-fat fries were amazing, the atmosphere is great, and if you like long legs and short skirts then you found your heaven.\\n\\nI need to check out some of the other Michael Mina restaurants if this is any indication.',\n",
       " 'This is hands down one of the best steakhouse I went to.   Good job Micheal.  Hopefully he brings this restaurant to San Francisco, as it blows away all the other steakhouses there.  I was not disappointed here.  \\n\\nMy friend and I started off our dinner, after watching \"Love\", with the Crab Cakes, Tomato Preserve, Tabasco Vinaigrette and the Lobster, Chilled, Black Truffle Vinaigrette,Baby Lettuces.  Both were excellent.  They even gave us the StripSteak Trio of Duck Fat Fries complementary. The sauces severed with the fries were a barbecue, truffle, and ketchup.  The truffle sauce was the best.  Our entrees were the American Kobe Rib Cap and American Kobe Fillet Mignon.  Both of the Kobe beef was cooked to perfection of medium rare and seasoned perfectly.  It was so soft, that you didn\\'t need a knife to cut it, especially the rib cap...gotta love that marbled fat. We accompanied our steaks with the Sauteed Baby Brussel Sprouts, Bacon Lardon Steam Asparagus, Mascarpone Beurre Blanc.  The brussel sprouts were out of this world...again, cheers to fat, this time the bacon.\\n\\nI was so stuffed, but I forged on to eat dessert. I had to live it up as it was my last night in Vegas.  We both shared the beignet with butterscotch pudding and the dough nut with banana fosters. Both desserts were OK, and here is where I think the improvement needs to be made.  The butterscotch pudding was not memorable, as it was not as sweet as I would have liked it to be.  \\n\\nI would have given it 5 stars, but the dessert was a little let down. But the services was excellent.  Shout out to our server Kyle, another local boy from Hawaii, \"you da best\".  In all, a very enjoyable dinner.  Plus they gave me one of the menu\\'s when I asked if they had a take home version. \\n\\nCome here for the American Kobe beef, and if you really want the authentic Kobe A5, that too.   mmmm...marbled beef.......drool.',\n",
       " \"This is definitely a change from 3940. The openness of the restaurant makes it very comfortable. The bar is beautiful with it's plexiglass or real glass lookalike....Sidecars with a cinnamon surprise. Duck fat FRIES! WOO HOO! I actually had...surprise surprise...Bone in RibEye...Mmmm Kobe is over rated. It's American Kobe anyway not the wagyu. had the asparagus. Very nice....and I think I had the fancy mashed potatoes. I didn't want to say puree. I didn't want any one to know I'm a fancy boy....eating the fancy foods....Over all. Michael Mina did a good Job. I was happy with the service and quality of food. The only thing I didn't like....kids...like teen agers....ewww they let them in places like that?\",\n",
       " 'I have been in Las Vegas all week working NBA All-Star. Last night we had dinner at Michael Mina\\'s new franchise Strip Steak. Bobby Flay was at the table next to ours with his crew. Raj as usual has put together a nice wine list though we all found it a bit strange that there are so many Austrian Rieslings\\' at a restaurant that revolves largely around meat and more meat. Maybe I am missing something... I found the food a bit mediocre particularly for the price ($36 for skirt steak or $50 for a filet. The Kobe beef started at $50 for American to $195 for Japanese, all ala carte.) The many sides of potatoes were nearly the consistency of a soup with some actually bleeding liquid when dished on to the plates. The mac n cheese though very tasty with the truffle oil was dry with absolutely no creaminess ever being apparent. The foie gras \"sliders\" though tasty and a very large portion of liver did not quite translate. The sweet potatoe mash was so dosed up on clove as to make it unedible.  For dessert we had the mini doughnuts with a trio of sauces. The sauces were tasty but unfortunately the doughnuts were over cooked and very dry. Service however was exceptional and friendly.\\n\\nFor wine we had a great bottle of 2004 Freeman Akiko\\'s Cuvee.\\nThe Akiko\\'s Cuvee has always been my favorite Freeman wine besides the chardonnays and last night was no exception. We popped and poured and she was away to the races right away. Out of the gate this wine has a haunting nose of cherries, cranberry and black licorice with baking spice and a touch of shitake mushroom. The palate is incredibly silky with super fine tannins with. Everyone at the table called it soft. Sweet ripe fruits are in abundance but the fine tannins keep them in check. The oak in this bottle is much more integrated than the last bottle I had providing an immensely seamless pleasurable experience.\\n91+pts\\n$115 on the list there',\n",
       " \"Well, the ambiance is wonderful but we were fooled the other night with another expensive place which had great looking sauces but was just bland even after the waiter said the sauce had a spice to it, it was bland. So we tried Michael Mina's StripSteak. My dining guest said Mina's name like I should know it, I think he has a restaurant in San Francisco too.\\n\\nFirst, the Rare Ahi, Nioise Garnish was just simple with simple seasoning that was perfect. I got the Prime Rib rare to check to see if they could do it right, because most place's rare prime rib is just not done slow enough and if not over done it is still just tough. I was very impress. And the Brussels sprouts we ordered was prepared all sliced up like cole slaw, we were both impressed. The lobster was cut in half long ways so it was no work at all to eat lobster. It was marked as market priced on the menu and we both bet to see who came close. I bet $50 and my friend said $60, it came to $74 but we both said it was seasoned well and was worth it, believe it  or not.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to have to find this other restaurant in San Francisco.\",\n",
       " 'If you happen to be a top notch chef - It has become fashionable to open a steakhouse. What better place to do it than in Vegas. This place is uber cool!\\n\\nThe menu is not as diverse as I expected with only a few selection of cuts but overall the quality was excellent. Add cool music, a busy bar and a good looking crowd and voila - a great Vegas hangout.',\n",
       " \"Who should eat here:  Some one that wants a great steak, and price is no object.  Let me repeat: price is no object (this place is off the charts expensive, and yes I do know its Vegas, and Mina's name is on it)\\n \\n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\\n3 Stars - Adequate\\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\\n \\nAmbience/Atmosphere: 3.5 stars.  Big and open, with a very modern a sleek feel.  I found it a bit uncomfortable to be honest, but I guess not that bad for Vegas.  Has a cool bar, and the cocktails are very good.  \\n \\nService: 4 stars.  A tiny bit cold and service is a little bit snotty, but not to the point where it would bother you.  They know what they are doing and they are extremely professional.  They will not miss a beat at all, but I found overall they were very un-personable.  \\n \\nFood: 4.5 stars.  Mina has done it again with the food.  First off they brought us three little cones filled with french fries, with three dipping sauces.  Not a big fan of fries, but these were pretty damn good, cooked to a crispy light brown, they had the most flavor I think I have ever experience in a french fry.  I had a American Kobe steak tartar to start.  They prepared it table side, mixing the small pieces of chopped steak with 9 ingredients and spices.  This app was off the charts.  Probably a little too rich if you plan on having a steak for you main, but if you are going to go for an alternative or are just getting apps, ORDER THIS DISH!  The meat in the tartar could have been some of the most delicious steak I have had in a long time.  It literally melted in my mouth.  For entree I opted for the pork loin.  This dish was crazy good and I will have to say exceeded my expectations in every way possible.  If you are not going to order a steak for your main, I would seriously consider this as an option.  It had a bitter orange type sauce that was sooo good, and was perfect with the flavors of the pork.  Given time constraints we passed on dessert, so no comment on the sweets.\\n \\nWine: 4 stars.  First off Strip has a 5 star wine list, I am knocking it a star because it has no value.  Expect well over a double in mark up, and in most cases more.  The staff is well skilled on the list, which was a plus for me too.  If price is no object I would focus on some of the Bordeaux on the list, they have all the trophies.  But be prepared to put a big dent in the wallet.\\n \\nOverall:  Well this definitely is Mina in style.  He really knows how to create a food experience.  I have to say though, I would really struggle to recommend Strip to anyone, given that I don't think the experience really holds up to the prices.  I really have never had a problem paying a lot for dinner, but this was a little ridiculous.  Good luck, and happy dining.\",\n",
       " 'I had the rib bye medium rare done and it was perfect, probably one of the best steak I had in years. Then I had  the mini duncan donuts for dessert served with some type of chocalate ice cream and caramel dips. I was full all night and it was worth every penny.  Definately make reservation  ahead of time especially if you have a big party.',\n",

Wine-pairing dead on. I pity the fool who doesn't utilize the knowledgeable staff, and all they have to recommend.\\n\\nUnforgettable:  \\n\\n1) Lobster fritters on a stick w/ creme fraiche (like fancypants corn dogs!)\\n\\n2) Sublime skirt steak, the ultimate test of a steak place, this one was incredible in texture and flavor\\n\\n3) Trio of duck fat fries, mmm animal fat=flavor\\n\\n4) Trio of potato purees (lobster, corn, &  horseradish), a great creamy smear to dollop onto your steak while you eat it\\n\\nAfter a delish dessert, and an aperitif, bfriend and I were warmly sent on our way with a little bag of fiddle-faddle. How cute it that?\\n\\nMAD PROPS to my fellow yelpster Ms.Elizabeth B.  for insisting that I eat here.\",\n",
       " \"Fabulous experience here!  The food was fantastic, from the crab louis lettuce cups to the 3 pots of different flavoured mash potato.  \\n\\nBut it's all about the BEEF at this place.  And it is fantastic.  The wife and I did an Angus/Kobe Filet taste test.  Take my advice, dont try the same test.  The Angus was about as good as any I had tried, but once you try the Kobe, it just isnt in the same league.  We went for the American Kobe which was 70 bucks for the Filet, as apposed to the Japanese A5 Kobe which was 180 bucks!  And it was succulent and juicy, and almost caused me to drool as I chewed.  Unfortunately my wife liked it as well, so she eat most of it!\\n\\nService was excellent.  Immaculate servers, and most of them quite attractive.... if tall attractive women in skimpy outfits is your bag.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place if you are visiting the strip.  Mandalay Bay may be at the far end of the strip, but this place is worth the trip.\",\n",
       " \"StripSteak is Michael Mina's fourth restaurant in Las Vegas, and his first steak house. Main courses are pretty much what you'd expect of a steak house: lots of steak, and some seafood. Beef lovers may choose between Angus beef, Wagyu beef (what most places call Kobe) and, if memory serves, true Kobe beef. There are some surprises in the side dishes. I failed to write any down except those I ended up ordering: duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones.\\n\\nThe feel is modern, with lots of glass and steel. An industrial ceiling is high above, below which is a checkerboard latticework of what looks like stainless steel. The floor is speckled black, white, and gray granite tile. In the bar area, the bar top is glass with a stainless steel edge at the back. Servers are dressed in black. Loud rock music is playing.\\n\\nI opted for a ridiculously unhealthy meal: Angus filet mignon; duck fat fries; roasted marrow bones. The filet was firm, a little dry, but with a nice charcoal flavor. It was served with two small roasted peppers and a bulb of roasted garlic. The duck fat fries were very interesting: three small cups of french fries, with three flavors (BBQ; truffle; unknown) and three sauces (BBQ; mayonnaise; catsup). The fries were crisp, almost crunchy, and tasted great. Highly recommended. The roasted marrow bones were very good, with lots of rich marrow; very good with steak. This is something you either love or hate.\\n\\nThis isn't the best steak house in town, but it's an interesting addition - more for the side dishes than the steak. Prices are high but not outrageous for food that is good but not stellar. I might come back to see what other side dishes look interesting.\",\n",
       " \"Five stars for Foie Gras Sliders!\\nFive stars for Trio of fries cooked in Duck fat! So Fucking Good!\\nFive stars for Kobe carpaccio!\\nFive stars for Wagyu Kobe filet!\\nFive stars for service!\\nDefinetely best steakhouse in LV. Probably the best steakhouse I've ever been to.\",\n",
       " \"A colleague and I were just in LV on biz and decided to walk around to see what dining Mandalay Bay had to offer. We were torn between the modern Asian restaurant and StripSteak - I'm glad we chose the latter.\\n\\nInterior was modern, masculine and bold (just like a good man), and while busy at dinner time, it didn't feel crowded. The service was surprisingly good. Now, I'm gonna sound like a girl-hater, which I'm not...mostly...but our waitress was beautiful and booby, but instead of some Hooter's clone-bot, we were treated to some damned personable, knowledgeable service! She was attentive without being overbearing, and cheerfully shared her choice items from their menu.\\n\\nPricing knocked me a little off my grandpa rocker, especially since in scanning the wine list, I could only find two $40 bottles of wine, with the most expensive being $28K. Instead, we opted for cocktails, which were spot on!\\n\\nEvery table was brought a trio of duck fried french fries with dipping sauces. A perfect opener to a delightfully debaucherous dinner. Steak was prepared exactly as we requested. Also worthy of note: my co-worker is a meat snob (which doesn't mean she's NOT a slut, because on the contrary...) and she was, in rare form, impressed. Our sides - the onion rings and truffle mac 'n cheese - were also noteworthy, but, unfortunately, we could only have a few spoon fulls of the mac since it was rich and creamy (probably better to order when dining with a larger group).\\n\\nOverall: a superb experience, but be prepared to shell out the dough.\",\n",
       " 'No complaints about the food whatsoever.  All of us were more than happy with our meals.  Steaks and side dishes (creamed spinach, blue cheese scalloped potatoes) were great, as were the duck fat fries.  Only knocked down a star because you should never, ever have to listen to Carl Douglas\\' \"Kung Fu Fighting\" while eating in a steakhouse.  Otherwise, a great experience.',\n",
       " \"Ate here last night with friends, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I dont normally review places on the strip, or in Vegas casinos, since I live here. I usually leave those places up to the tourists. Although since my opinion of this restaurant differs from most of the other reviews here, I figured I'd share.\\nI had the Rare ahi appetizer, which was good, and probably the best part of the meal in my opinion, and then the dry aged porterhouse steak as my entree. The steak, unfortunately, was nothing to write home about. And for $51 I expected a pretty good steak. I was prepared well, but didnt seem to have any flavor to it. The dry aged steaks at Capitol grille, are SO much more flavorful. I also had the grilled foie gras with the steak, and it wasnt too bad. I guess for a steak house in Mandalay bay, I expected it to be alot better. \\nThe Service was very good, and the restaurant itself was very nice. I have eaten at every other restaurant in Mandalay Bay, and they have all been great, but I think Stripsteak fell a little short.\",\n",
       " \"I visited StripSteak only because a friend was in love with their macaroni and cheese and wanted to see if she could get it carryout after we'd attended a concert at The Beach in Mandalay Bay.  While the hostesses at the podium at first seemed a little uncertain about whether we'd be able to order it, they directed us to the bar where the bartender was more than happy to place the order for us.  \\n\\nThe bartender was excellent- he was very friendly and asked us where we were from. I thought great, I'm from Vegas so he'll probably ignore us after we tell him.  But no- he was just as friendly, and after my friend left to play in the casino while Iwaited for our order, he brought me water with lemon (and refilled the glass) and continued to chat.  \\n\\nI guess this is just a review of the bar and the bartender, but I must add that the restaurant was beautiful- shiny floors, and some of the tables were glowing from lights underneath them.  I want to come here now and experience the restaurant due to the good first impression I got.\",\n",
       " \"My friend is a Michael Mina fan and a big red meat fan, therefore, we had to go to StripSteak. We got a reservation last minute and were seated right away on a Saturday night.\\n\\nWe had french fries fried in duck oil, served with three different sauces (the Michael Mina way).\\nThen a tasty salad and our steaks. My friend wanted to try the Japanese Kobe and I wanted the skirt steak. But he also wanted to try the American Kobe to compare, so I ended up getting that to indulge him since I didn't know when he would be able to do the comparison side-by-side again.\\n\\nOur waiter explained the different cuts of meat to us and even brought out the raw rib-eyes before cooking to show us the difference between American and Japanese Kobe. I guess if you're paying hundreds of dollars for meat, they're going to make sure you know what you're buying.\\n\\nI liked the way the restaurant was set up. The service wasn't as great as I had hoped besides the steak show. I had to signal for water a couple of times.\\n\\nOverall dinner and dessert were good.

Since we had a party of 6, we sat in one of the booths, which was quite comfortable. The most distracting (and entertaining) part of the evening, were women who cam dressed rather scanty.\\n\\nService: I did feel a bit uncomfortable with the staff, since we didn't order the high-priced items.

With its classic menu, inviting bar scene and sophisticated atmosphere, STRIPSTEAK plays host to guests looking for the perfect filet in a modern alternative to the traditional steakhouse setting. As with Mina's other restaurants, STRIPSTEAK uses only the highest quality ingredients - corn-fed, all-natural meat; line-caught seafood and fresh, seasonal produce. While first-rate components are essential, it is Mina's creative approach to cooking that has made his name.\\n\\nSTRIPSTEAK features a menu rife with imaginative interpretations of classic steakhouse favorites using state-of-the-art kitchen equipment. STRIPSTEAK offers three kinds of beef, Certified Angus Beef, American Kobe and 'A5' Japanese Kobe, and is home to two wood-burning grills and six circulating, slow-poaching chambers. The signature slow-poaching method enhances flavor and tenderness by heating the meat for several hours at a low temperature, while the mesquite-stoked grills infuse every cut with a subtle smokiness.\\n***\\n\\nWith that said, this place is devilishly good.  The modern decor coupled with a menu that will send your taste buds dancing earns this place the coveted 5th star.  While enjoying my meal, my friends, and the talent on display in walks....da da dum Andre Agassi.  Wow!\\n\\nHe was very lively, his presence filled the room.  He was engaging with the many guests requesting pics.  I was too befuddled to reach for my camera.  Don't ask me why something about being so close to a multiple Grand Slam Champion.  Turns out he is a part owner in this latest iteration of Michael Minna's restaurants.  Go, enjoy and keep your eyes peeled you never know who you might catch a glimpse of.\",\n",
       " 'Stripsteak sucked. My steak was overcooked, the trio of pureed potatoes or whatever they call it was a joke, and the trio of \"duck fat\" fries must have been fried in 5% duck fat or something, because they tasted like something Burger King would serve (except for the white truffle ones, but how can you screw that up, really?).\\n\\nThe three pureed potatoes dishes were lobster, which, while I love big chunks of lobster, tasted like an experiment on how to get starchy potatoes and a bag of white flour into a pasty goo reminiscent of gruel which clung so steadfastly to the lobster chunks that it didn\\'t offer the opportunity to salvage them from the muck, the sour cream and chive version, almost as gooey and I guess was worth one taste, and the third, horseradish, I guess was supposed to be some kind of traditional take on wasabi mashed potatoes you would have seen on every menu five years ago.\\n\\nService wasn\\'t anything to brag about either. This is another one of those places where they really need to train their waitstaff a little better. For this kind of money and they large crowd it draws, they should be watching for your fork and knife to come together on the plate in the interest of turning the table over. We waited a long time for our check, and I think they only took notice when I got up to use the restroom.',\n",

The meal started out promising enough with the yummy duck fat fries trio and the tuna tartare poppers trio.  Then the spinach souffle came out which turned out to be more cake than vegetable.  The waitress had recommended this after my husband said that we wanted a vegetable.  Cake cooked with vegetable doesn't exactly count in my book.  I ordered a the Kobe skirt steak which was too salty and too raw on one end and overdone on the other.  The salty seasoning upset my stomach.  My husband ordered the prime rib which was decent enough but nothing really special.  We did enjoy the creme fraiche horseradish though.  As my stomach was acting up, I didn't order dessert just some mint tea to settle the tummy.\\n\\nThe worst thing was the foccacia bread.  It tasted doughy and wet like it was undercooked.

Not sure what was going on there.   \\n\\nMaybe it was an off night but the food was really disappointing.

First it was the free duck fries. I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking ew.. duck fries. It's not really duck, just regular ol' french fries with a new name. The condiments it came with however, nothing close to regular. I remember it was 3 types of condiments, forgot the flavors but remember it being delicious. I think I ended up fighting with my date on who could have the last duck fry. \\n\\nThe steak..MMMM...mouth watering. *Insert picture of Homer Simpson drooling* I had a petite filet and loved it. My date on the other hand, had Kobe steak. I had a piece of his steak and had entree envy right away. His Kobe beef was exactly how Kobe beef should taste like, tender and full of flavor.\\n\\nYou would think after pigging out on fries and steak, that we would be done right? WRONG. We decide to order blueberry fritters for dessert. My God were they delicious. Even though I was dying from over eating I couldn't help wanting more. \\n\\nWe won't discuss the bill. I just know it was expensive. =X\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place, just ignore the dumb hostess and you'll be fine.\",\n",
       " \"One of the best meals of my life! This review is going to be long, for those that are interested in details... move along if you aren't. \\n\\nWe were seated in the lounge. Maybe because we looked young? Maybe because we were only semi-dressed up? Who knows, but the lounge was great... service was awesome, chairs were comfy, and the guys will love the outfits the waitresses wear in this section. \\n\\nComplimentary duck fat fries... to be honest, this wasn't that good! I've had duck fat fries in Chicago and wow, these don't even compare to those. However, they were free, so I'm not complaining. \\n\\nKobe tartare... soo.. soo.. good! Very incredible presentation. Comes out on a plate with tons of ingredients around it (mustard, salt, etc) and they mix it into a ceviche looking/dip type stuff tableside and put it in a martini glass over ice..you spread it on hot grilled pita bread. So freaking amazing. \\n\\nFor our main course, we got 1 american kobe filet ($72), and the foie gras sliders! Both were so incredible. Steak was the best steak of my life.. hands down, can't compare any other steak to it. Perfectly marbled fat, but still lean.. not an ounce of chewiness. Foie gras sliders were little bites of heaven. I love foie gras, but usually find it way too rich, BUT placed on a bun with a sort of pear mixture, it was flawless. The flavors just worked perfectly. Best presentation of foie gras I've eaten, ever, anywhere. \\n\\nDessert was the beignets and creme brulee plate. I consider the beignets in NOLA much much better, but my bf disagreed. These were more dense than the ones I'm used to. \\n\\nOverall, can't recommend this place more. Dinner for 2 with 2 cocktails was $200 with tip, however we did split the foie gras sliders and a steak rather than getting 2 steaks. Definitely worth the splurge every once in awhile.\",\n",

My only regret is not getting the Japanese Kobe! One thing that I didn\\'t think was so special (but not enough to take away a star) was when we were served duck fries \"compliments of the chef\".

It didn't help that I ordered my steak medium rare, but it came out still mooing. Also, my potatoes were cold. \\n\\nOur Shabu Shabu app was delicous. The Kobe melted in my mouth. The  complimentary Duck Fat Fries are straight addicting. Especially the White Truffle fries.   Our service was excellent, and we never wanted for anything.  Wine list is fantastic, but very pricey. I went with a Pear-Lychee Martini, which my friend commented tasted like his hair product. \\n\\nWe had wanted to have a glass of wine at Aureole before dinner, but the hostess said if we waited an hour they would be unable to seat us due the the RUSH concert ending. Somehow, I could not fathom hordes of mullet haired Rush fans descending on StripSteak. They never came. But later that evening, as I was happily  losing money in the casino they arrived in droves.

It was good, but I wasn\\'t feeling the big chunks of broccoli in it.\\n-Masami Farms American Kobe \"Eye\" of rib eye and fillet Mignon- were tender and cooked to perfection. steaks were garnished with a large roasted and steamed orange peppers added a sweet and slightly crunchiness to the steaks when eaten together.\\n- Spiced Carrot Cake- don\\'t expect a neatly sliced triangle or square cake topped with cream cheese. This dessert is very \"new age-ie\" where the cream cheese is smeared on the dish, the cake is crumbled like a decimated city and it\\'s dolloped with a scoop of carrot sorbet and vanilla ice cream.

       " 'When my friends told me we were going to a place called Strip Steak, I was assuming we\\'d be eating steak and watching strippers. What\\'s wrong with that combination? Steak... good! Strippers... good! In a fantasy world, such a place would exist. Unfortunately, that was not the case. At least they had great steak and that more than made up for the lack of strippers.  Turns out the strip in Strip Steak was because the restaurant was located in the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Ooooh. I get it.\\nWhat makes Strip Steak special is not strippers but how they cook their steaks. From what I understood from the waitress, they braise their steaks to the proper doneness and then finish them over an open flame for color. A boiled steak? Don\\'t knock it till you try it. Seriously the third best steak I\\'ve ever had. The number one spot goes to a Kobe Steak I had in Tokyo.\\n\\nThe only thing Strip Steak could improve on is if they offered more dry aged cuts of steak. At the time of this post, they only offered their Rib Eye dry aged. Our group ordered our steaks in a variety of doneness. One in our group got them to cook a steak the rarest the restaurant has ever cooked it. They\\'ve only done it one other time since they opened. Talk about an accomplishment, to be the second person to have a steak this rare. They are on the strip after all. Instead of par boiling the steak, they pulled it straight out of the fridge, quickly placed over the flame, and served it. To our surprise, there wasn\\'t even a drop of blood on the plate. \\n\\nThe next time I go, I\\'ll try the $200 Japanese Kobe 6oz filet mignon, but unfortunately, I \"donated\" that money to \"Red 14\". Any steak on the menu will definitely please your palate. One of our group suggests the lamb. Not gamey at all.',\n",

It was flavorful, yet not overpowering. and certainly not drowning in dressing.  The prime rib was my dessert, I mean entree.  So you see prime rib on a menu and you think Outback Steakhouse, right?  Not here.  They have a very inventive take.  The presentation allows you to get a different flavor combination of crust, meat and sauce with every bite.  As I got into eating it, I figured this out.  Mac & Cheese?  Crazy delicious.  Not your mom\\'s Kraft Mac & Cheese.    When I had consumed all I could, I still wanted more!  Excellent foodie experience.',\n",

He graciously offered that the kitchen could do some simple vegetables (spinach and garlic and mashed potatoes) which were just as he said, simple. Service was attentive and very helpful and the steak was juicy, cooked perfectly, but not out of this world. Complimentary Duck fat fries sound indulgent but its still just French fries and how fancy can those really get? Great wine selection. Pricing was on the high side as our meal for two with drinks and no room for dessert came out to a little over three bills. Crowd was hip but definitely not trendy.

Went this past weekend and have already made my reservations for my next trip in 2 weeks. \\n\\nSince everyone in my group was getting steaks, I decided to mooch off of them and indulge my self in other pleasantries. So I got the West Coast Kushi oysters - similar to Kumamotos - my fav. I also got the bone marrow - nothing spectacular - a bit plain actually, just the marrow and some toast. I like it when marrow is spruced up a bit with capers and greens. So I wont be ordering this again from here. I also wanted to get the Fois Grois but the waiter suggested the Pate. It was good, but wish I had gone with my previous choice. The Pate - since i was eating it by myself - was a bit too heavy for only one to consume, especially when paired with the rich taste of the marrow - my bad overall, I should have considered it. \\n\\nMy friend's Filet was AMAZING the most beautiful piece of meet you've ever seen. I will probably be getting that on ym next trip. My boyfriend's aged rib eye - rare - was succulent . My other friend got his rib eye med rare and it wa s bit too dry. We enjoyed a nice Syrah - $80, the lesser end of the list, but still lovely. \\n\\nThe scalloped potatoes were awesome, as was the jalapeno cream corn. The Sides there are a MUST - get as many as your stomach can handle! AND you may not think you have room for desert but share the coconut passion fruit sorbet plate with your table - you'll be glad you did.

The place is nicely designed and of course has the usual eye-candy-ish host staff at the front desk that you learn to expect at these fancy schmancy type places. The young blond hottie proceeded to seat me right next to another couple who were dressed to impress while I was looking slightly better than alley trash. My first thought was to ask to move, but then I decided that since I might get bored at any moment that I would just sit there and eavesdrop on their conversation. \\n\\nWhen I gamble I usually either GO BIG, or play really conservative, so I decided to treat this meal the same way. I pulled out a quarter and gave it a flip. Tails for cheap. Alright the theme has been set. Instead of ordering the $180 wagyu 8oz steak I opted for the 16? 18? oz $51bone-in rib-eye. For a side-dish I chose the \"caramelized onion and goat cheese scalloped potatoes\" which came in at like $13 or $14. I also ordered WATER. Bottled water sir? No, just regular water please. Oh and with the steak please bring me an $18 a glass of this cheap Cabernet. Would you like an appetizer to start off with sir? No. A salad or some crab-cakes? No thanks. I\\'m not really starving right now so I can wait. \\n\\nSo as the waiter rushes off I proceed to listen to the life-stories of this couple I was seated next to and waited for my food. Ahem, Sir the chef sent you this complimentary fries, three different types of fries, each paired with its own special dip. Actually these fries were pretty good, but if you go here, I wouldn\\'t spend 9 bucks for them, just wait for them to get comped. \\n\\nAnyhow, the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, but it had a little more fat and bone than I would have liked. The scalloped potatoes were excellent. A little rich for some people I would suspect but good for me. \\nWhile savoring the taste of the rib-eye, a thought occurred to me: When I cook rib-eyes over mesquite wood at home on my BBQ after seasoning them properly, they taste almost exactly like this. Ahh well, probably just overestimating my own potential again. \\n\\nTo give this place a fair review I would probably have to kick out more cash than the $94 bucks I spent here. It was good. It is probably a great place to take a date to impress or the wife/girlfriend/mistress for some special occasion.  I guess you are paying for the ambiance.  It was good and I\\'ll probably end up here again after pillaging the Mandalay blackjack tables, but not overly impressive, at least with the cheap stuff I ordered.',\n",

It would basically be borderline pornographic...\\n\\nThe three words you need to hear at the beginning of your dinner that ensures a very pleasurable experience... DUCK FAT FRIES (and a trio no less).  What an amazing thing!  Light, crispy, wonderful flavor.  I was expecting something that would be too rich to handle, but these were great.  Three flavors (bbq, truffle, herbed) with accompanying dipping sauces.  Yum.\\n\\nI decided to forego an appetizer as I really wanted to sink my teeth into some steak.  So tempted to go for Wagyu beef, but I went for an 18oz dry-aged Angus rib-eye... perfectly seasoned and cooked.  No need for any kind of sauce.  And the sides...\\n\\nThe sides!  Truffled mac n' cheese.... and not just mac n' cheese made with truffle oil, but actual truffle shavings in the sauce!  Heaven.  Creamed spinach with bacon... caramelized onion and goat cheese scalloped potatoes... and their complimentary foccacia bread.   \\n\\nFor dessert... Beignets with 18-year-old Scotch pudding... just the right amount of booziness.  The beignets were warm, light, and airy. \\n\\nAs if this isn't enough fried dough... i also ordered the Dunkin' mini doughnuts... these came with jasmine infused chocolate sauce and salted caramel sauce... yes...  yes...\\n\\nService was wonderful... The space is beautiful and modern.  \\n\\nThis is my second visit to a Michael Mina restaurant... he hasn't disappointed.   Can't wait to go to his other restaurants!\",\n",
       " '\"MY God, what have I done to deserve this\", were the words I spoke when eating here. Being in Las Vegas, Nevada, a.k.a. Sin City, I knew that I had to atone for my sins, but I do not know what sin I could have committed to deserve this place! I can not tell you how many times I\\'ve been disappointed by restaurants that tout their great service and even better food, then come away feeling despondent.\\n\\nHowever, this restaurant takes the proverbial cake, and a crap one at that!\\n\\nWhere to begin? After having been sitting at a table with my guest for 15 minutes, the waitress finally decided it was time to work. Realizing that she was indifferent, my guest and I ordered some red wine to numb the pain we knew lay ahead. When the wine came, it was as warm as the desert outside the hotel. Enduring this bit of pain, we decided to press our luck further.\\n\\nI ordered the Kobe steak which after about 40 minutes of wondering when my food would show up, came most disappointingly. Kobe beef, the most rarified and king of all steaks, prepared properly medium rare, came out well done. Well done! I was horrified to see such splendor squandered. I decided to take a bite and tasted charcoal. I was livid. I found my nonexistent, indifferent waitress and demanded to see the manager.\\n\\nA manager came round and apologized and brought me another Kobe steak, this time thankfully, faster than the last. When it finally arrived, it too suffered a cruel fate reserved only for witches in Salem. I spoke with the manager who brought out his manager. This new bloke apologized some more and took my meal off my bill. My bill? Yes, it seems I still had to pay for my guest whose food was only average. I feel that if one person\\'s meal is ruined, everyone\\'s is. Therefore everything should be taken care of. Sadly, Strip Steak doesn\\'t think this way. Strip Steak simply doesn\\'t think or cook for that matter. They can apologize well though.',\n",
       " \"Based on the way I look and my last name, most people think I'm Latin or of Spanish descent. \\n\\nAnd perhaps if you go back far enough in my heritage, you could say I am of Spanish descent... \\n\\nBut maybe it's also because I am a carnivore and because I'm a late diner. I mean LATE. Like I have dinner at 11pm.\\n\\nFortunately for me, Stripsteak more than satisfies my needs as a late dining carnivore.\\n\\nOn a late Monday night, my girlfriend and I made the trek to Mandalay Bay to have dinner at Stripsteak and were nothing short of impressed.\\n\\nWe were greeted and seated promptly, given professional & knowledgeable service and treated to a wonderful meal of complimentary duck-fat fries, beets & burrata salad, crab louie lettuce cups; amazing lamb & heavenly-flavored, mesquite-roasted rib-cap steak.\\n\\nI have to say, if you love rib-eye, you will LOVE Stripsteak's rib-cap. 10oz of wonderfully seasoned juicy Angus steak.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to satisfy my inner Spanish demons!\",\n",

The duck fat fries are a must, people.  Also, the burratta salad was fresh and delicious, and my boyfriend's rib cap steak was incredible.  He said that it was one of the BEST steaks he's ever had in his entire life.  Coming from a 32 year old extreme carnivore, that's pretty substantial.  Also, my lamb chops were scrumptious as well.\\n\\nIn addition, the bill ended up not being ridiculously high as we anticipated.  I'd say Strip Steak rivals N9NE in terms of the type of ambiance and crowd they are attempting to attract.

       " 'I hope to get through this review without drooling all over my laptop. \\n\\nSo I chose this place for My boyfriend\\'s 30th birthday dinner, and it\\'s one of those happy occasions where I cannot imagine a better choice.  As soon as we sat down in the plush chairs in the middle of the gorgeous but unpretentious dining room, and picked up the Happy Birthday card the establishment had written out to my beau, it felt right.\\n\\nThen we started sipping the best cocktails we\\'ve ever had.  Birthday boy tried the Claymore, an intriguing blend of Scotch, elderflower syrup, and Lambic beer. Sounded flat-out weird, but was out-of-this-world good. Just a little sweet and you could totally taste the smoothness of that good Scotch. \\n\\nBefore we order, we are presented with a trio of french fries with their own dipping sauces! Herb with Ketchup, Duck Fat with Truffle sauce, and Paprika with Barbecue. I\\'m afraid I\\'m gonna bust out another superlative. I don\\'t wanna get discredited that way, but hot damn, these were best fries I\\'d ever had. Specifically the duck fat and truffle sauce. What can I say about those fries? When you ate them, the world fell away. It was just you, the fried potato, and the truffle sauce.\\n\\nBirthday boy picked an appetizer that the server recommended: Lobster and bacon fritters wrapped in bibb lettuce with a meyer lemon creme fraiche. Not my thing at all, but he was quite content with it. \\n\\nMeahwhile, I reveled in a fantastical salad of tri-colored beets with burrata. Do you know burrata? It\\'s a fresh mozzarella that\\'s made molten with cream.  It\\'s hard to make, and its quite expensive. It\\'s often flaunted on a menu as the star of a dish, but then miniscule in portion compared to the other ingredients. Not here, at Stripsteak! I enjoyed two healthy-sized, mouth-watering balls of exquisite burrata, which were complimented just perfectly with the lightly dressed roasted beets. At $15, this was a deal. \\n\\nBetween the cocktail, beets, and fries, I probably didn\\'t need to consume much more, but then our steaks came. We both ordered filet mignon ($54). There was nothing MIGNON about these steaks, they were enormous! I ordered mine \"Rare- really rare\" and I was happy to see that the while the outside was seared dark, it was red and cold beyond a few millimeters. It was perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. \\n\\nNow, at Ruth Chris and the like, the $8 sides of sauteed vegetables or baked potatoes remind you of the expensive wrappings and bows you have to buy for a wedding gift. A necessary accompaniment to the main event that makes it pretty and complete, but would be utterly useless and ridiculous if purchased on their own. \\n\\nThe sides here at Stripsteak are NOT wrapping paper. You could bring a vegetarian to Stripsteak and they would be just as happy with these sides as the carnivores with their meat. \\n\\nTruffled Macaroni and cheese. **Maniacal laugh heard here at the mention of this dish.** According to our server, the best thing on the menu. No arguments here!\\n\\nWe also had Scalloped potatoes with goat cheese. Giving the mac a run for its money.\\n\\nIf that wasn\\'t enough gluttony to invoke wrath from the Gods, we also had an accompaniment of grilled foie gras. Each bite bursted with sinful flavor as it instantly melted on our tongues. \\n \\nI cannot express to you how blessed we were to be eating these side dishes. It was pure, unfettered bliss. This is comfort-food that grew up to be a gorgeous, confident Gourmet. It\\'s the best of both worlds. \\n\\nWe played happily with combining these flavors. This bite is filet with truffled mac. This bite is filet with goat cheese. This bite is filet with a bit of the roasted shallot, the most delicious garnish in town. \\n\\nAnd then there was the moment that I realized \"Hey! What about the trufffle dipping sauce from the fries? I bet that will taste good with the steak!\"\\n\\nI never thought I was going to be able to eat that enormous steak, but despite being at capacity, I ate and ate and ate until everything was gone. \\n\\nThe birthday boy chose beignets with chocolate mouse dipping sauce, not my thing, and then I happily paid the $300 bill. \\n\\nIt was worth it.',\n",

Keep that stuff in the can plz.\\n\\nI got a roasted beet salad, which I expected to be a little more rustic... but they kind of tasted like canned beets.  And too much of the white cheese! \\n\\nOrdered the truffled mac and cheese after being convinced by the waiter...\\nonly OK, not blown away and couldn't really taste whatever was truffled.  I think they use the word truffle as a license to charge and extra $5. :/\\n\\nMy dry aged steak was pretty damn good, which I would have been pissed if it wasn't for $60.  \\n\\nMy dad's waygu tip steak thing was also tender and delicious. \\n\\nBrothers pork and collards with grits was only ok.

We started with some appetizers and wine by the bar because dinner had not started yet and were pleasantly intrigued with what else they had to offer.\\nWe ordered the oysters and the foie gras sliders with pear compote.  Two of our very favorite foods and both were spectacular! We had to stay for dinner.\\nWe were moved to the dining area where we both had the waygu Japanese rib eye med-rare of course.

We didn't have a reservation for our party of six, but we were able to get a table right away just before the place started to fill up (around 7:30 PM on a Tuesday).  For appetizers, we decided to stick with the complimentary duck fat fries with matching dipping sauces.  These were excellent...if that was all I had to eat here I would have left very satisfied.  I followed this with the house salad, then the 18 oz. dry-aged bone-in ribeye.  I ordered my steak medium rare, and it came out perfect, the steak was very tasty.  We ordered a side dishes to split amongst the table: carrots, truffled mac and cheese, shiitake mushrooms, and scalloped potatoes.  All were excellent, though my favorite by far was the mac and cheese.  We were all very satisfied with our meals and with the service.  Angus steaks range from $36 to $69 while the Wagyu beef starts at $64 for an 8 oz. American Kobe ribeye and goes up from there.\",\n",
       " \"My first experience at a Michael Mina restaurant, and I was impressed!\\n\\nAfter I found out they serve imported Japanese A5 Wagyu, I had to try it!\\n\\nI called to check the price the night before.. $185 for a 6oz Ribeye.  Pricey! It was the most expensive steak I've ever had.  Although I prefer Filet, if it's really A5, it should be just as tender as a Filet.   I think the Wagyu at CUT at the Palazzo is A3, but don't hold me to that. \\n\\nI decided to risk it, and I arrived on a Tuesday Eve around 6pm w/o reservations.  I was seated on arrival.  The booth was very comfortable with fluffy pillows.   \\n\\nInstead of bread, they served a complimentary trio of Duck Fat fries.  They each had different seasonings, and dipping sauces.  \\n\\nI liked the garlic sauce the best, it was very thin, and rich and I knew I was racking up the calories when I was eating it.   It was one of the best dipping sauces I've ever had. The fries themselves were maybe 3.5-4 star, not the best I've had, but better than average.  I usually don't use dipping sauces on my fries, but the garic dip was excellent.   \\n\\nThe fries were better than Wolfgang's CUT steakhouse french fry side dish. \\n\\nI ordered the A5 Japanese Ribeye Wagyu ($185) along with Foie Gras as a side ($19)\\n\\nIt came pretty fast.  The restaurant itself wasn't very busy.  I dropped by the night before around 830-9, and it looked alot busier.   The bar was packed, though.\\n\\nThe steak was good. It was very tender, as I expected.  Very buttery, and rich.  The seasoning was outstanding.  The steak came pre sliced in thin slices, about 8-10 pieces.  I suppose they can make sure it is cooked correctly throughout.   Mine came out medium rare, as requested.  \\nCompared to the wagyu filet I tried at CUT in Beverly Hills, I have to say this comes very close to being the best steak I've ever had.  It was on Par, for sure... \\n\\nThe foie gras was maybe the best I've ever had! It was more tender than the steak, like butter, served hot, and was very rich.  It was well worth the $19.   \\n\\nI had no room for dessert, and nothing looked too appetizing to me. \\nOverall, a very outstanding meal for a very expensive price.   Bring your wallet, the total with tax and tip was nearly $270.  That is for just 1 person. The soda is $4 a pop w/ no freebie refills.\",\n",

(It's fairly easy to tell the difference between the two types of restaurants, just watch for the rich old guys wheeling their oxygen tanks towards the former.)\\n\\nI went for the lamb, my colleagues for the strip steaks.  Entrees check in around $50-ish.  All were expertly prepared.  For sides, we shared the spinach souffle (excellent, imaginative), the creamed spinach with bacon (good, but a bit ordinary), and a baked potato (not much you can do to sex that up).\\n\\nIf you want a good, large hunk of cow before you go out to hit the bars, StripSteak will get you in that mood.

The steak is first heated in warm BUTTER before it is grilled.   This process results in the richest, most tender, most flavorful steak I have ever had.  I'm sure the cut of steak we chose also helped, we both had the ribeye cap.  The cap is the ultra rich and soft outside layer of the ribeye.

       " 'I loved this place. This place \"was. an. experience.\" It\\'s a surprisingly chic place not far from Fleur de Lys in Mandalay Bay and right next to a Starbucks. It was packed and loud, so I guess that\\'s a good sign. \\nTo be honest, I wasn\\'t impressed with our waiter. He seemed like a casual Billy Corgan type who was interested in talking to you so long as you were increasing your order. No small talk, 0 personality, and the real piss ant is he conveniently didn\\'t add our restaurant.com coupon to our bill. He may have forgotten, but frankly this is the second time this has happened to me in Vegas, and seeing how just about every other attraction in Vegas is designed to suck the money out of your pocket I can\\'t help but wonder if it\\'s not a coincidence. They must slip more than a few bills under the noses of patrons who unknowingly assume they got their discount but fail to check after a bottle of wine, but not me, and I\\'m not too forgiving about this ether, because I think it really is intentional. \\nAnyway, the food is what saved this place from a more negative review because in the end that is all I really and truly care about anyway. Anyone can learn how to carry a plate of food to a table, but it takes a talented individual to craft a work of art in the kitchen. \\nWe had salad to start. Frankly I wasn\\'t impressed with my caesar.  It seemed a bit bland. I was hoping this wouldn\\'t be precursor to the rest of the meal but in this rare occasion it wasn\\'t at all. Salad must not be their thing because the rest of the meal was mind blowing. I had a regular filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and another side of the creamed corn. Ummmm....the food was utterly fantastic. The filet was of EXCELLENT quality. Perfect taste and texture throughout, and the accompanying pepper sauce was not a creamy peppercorn sauce like you usually get, but more of a demi glace sauce with peppercorns - truly the sauce I have been after for years.\\nThe sides of the mashed potatoes 3 ways was stunning. They serve 3 little bowls of mashed taters. One is sour cream and chives infused, the other is lobster infused, and the third is horseradish infused. Each was the creamiest, smoothest mashed potato I have ever had, and was accented perfectly with its character ingredient. Wow. With the steak it was just superb. The creamed corn with jalapeno was very good, although not the best ever. Still very nicely done though and no complaints.\\nTo top it off, and the reason this place is a solid 5 star experience and worthy of one of the most smitten reviews I have ever posted was the simple divine experience I had with the Executive Chef, Ben (lost his business card but remember his name).\\nI was walking out of the restroom, and stopped by to look at their see-through window next to the grill where they cook the steaks and other entrees. I noticed what seemed to be a chef standing nearby, so in a spontaneous moment of gratitude I went up to him and told him how much I enjoyed my food. He was very nice, and after I asked a few more questions about how the steak is prepared, he said \"come on, I\\'ll take you back.\" He actually took me back in the kitchen past all the kitchen staff who were probably thinking \"WTF is this guy doing in here?\", and took me straight up to the grill where a few beautiful steaks were in the home stretch. He explained the process, how the steaks actually soak in clarified butter at a perfectly controlled temperature before they are grilled. This would explain the awesomeness of the steak, actually, but now that I\\'ve tasted it I know that it\\'s the best. He enthusiastically answered my other questions about the kitchen (\"is it really like Hell\\'s Kitchen??\") and then ushered me out of the kitchen. I don\\'t know why this is such a big deal to me, but it really just impressed the heck out of me that the Executive Chef of one of the best restaurants I\\'d ever been to was so down to Earth and gave me an impromptu tour of his kitchen. I remember as a young boy my dad would approach the cockpits of planes even during flights sometimes to talk to the pilots, and they would bring us into the cockpit, explain a few neat things, and then with a wink we\\'d be on our way. Obviously those days are gone forever, but tonight I had a bit of the same feeling; the man running the ship gave me the tour with no expectation of anything in return. Clearly I don\\'t believe this kind of thing happens that much anymore and that\\'s why I\\'m so ecstatic, but it was a privilege and an honor to meet him and I cannot thank him enough for his exemplary skills as both a chef and a business man. \\nI\\'m a fan of Strip Steak for sure. Maybe next time if I win big in Vegas I\\'ll try the Japanese Kobe (it\\'s not cheap). Until then I\\'ll enjoy a superb domestic cut of beef and be glad I can afford the luxury.',\n",
       " 'StripSteak is a fine steakhouse but, unfortunately, doesn\\'t live up to the hype.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with something positive.  The ambience, to be expected, is excellent.  Good use of wood, and in an open, non-stuffy, modern way.  \\n\\nThey start you off with some complimentary french fries and potato bread.  The fries are gourmet (one kind is cooked in duck fat) and are good, but not great.  (In fact, I had some McDonalds fries the next afternoon which left me just as satisfied).  The bread is a bit dry.  I would never order it.\\n\\nAs for the drinks, I had a glenlivet 12 (can\\'t report much there) and a cucumber martini.  The cucumber martini was perfect for a hot Vegas day (95 degrees) and was refreshing.  I also haven\\'t been to too many places that offer a cucumber martini, so that was nice.  As for the drink itself, it was un-nuanced.  Overall, though, I\\'d get it again.\\n\\nOnto the steaks.  I\\'ve been on a wagyu kick lately and like to compare the different restaurants that offer it, so I was glad to see they offered it here.  The price is supposedly market, so on this night, it was $185 for a 6 oz. New York.  In short, I was disappointed.  First, they serve it pre-sliced.  That pissed me off.  Pre-slicing alters the surface/area ratio, which means that each slice gets cold quickly.  I tried to return the steak to get a new one that wasn\\'t pre-sliced, but the most they would do was \"flash\" the steak.  B.S.  In any event, the steak itself fell way below expectations.  Unlike CUT, the wagyu at StripSteak did not melt in my mouth and I still had to chew (ok, at CUT you do have to chew, but barely).  I would never order the wagyu here again.\\n\\nI went with four other guys and none of them were impressed with their steaks (they don\\'t even go to nice steakhouses often).  In fact, one said that the steak at Lawry\\'s \"destroyed\" the steak at StripSteak.  That gives you some context.\\n\\nOn the other hand, StripSteak\\'s truffled macarroni and cheese was truly divine.  In all seriousness, and forgive me for the superlatives, it was the best mac & cheese I\\'ve ever had, and by a wide margin.  For the truffled mac & cheese alone, I would go back to StripSteak.  If you go, it is a must order.\\n\\nFinally, and it must be said since I\\'m a guy, the other reason to go to StripSteak is that one of their servers, Tori, is perhaps the prettiest girl you will ever see in real life.  I\\'m really not joking on that one (it was the consensus amongst the 5 guys at my table, as well as the table of 8 guys sitting next to us).  Ridiculous.\\n\\nSo, at the end of the day, 3 solid stars for StripSteak.  Can\\'t say it\\'s the best steakhouse (or even close to it), but it is a place to grab a good meal with a nice ambience and pretty scenery.',\n",
       " \"With all the steakhouse options in Vegas, do not waste your time with Stripsteak.  We were first seated in the bar at a lounge chair and a high table.  I have no idea how they expected us to eat a steak sitting at the kids table.  We were eventually able to move to a normal table and after a good 25 minutes, we got a waiter to come by and take some drink orders and we also placed our food orders.  I got a soup appetizer which was pretty good.  While waiting for the steaks, which arrived a good 35 minutes after appetizers, I started to feel sick and had to run to the restroom.  I'm not saying it was their fault, and I'm not saying it wasn't.  My wife finished her over salted steak while I was in the restroom being sick and the waiter and manager firmly told her that she had to pay the bill in full and they couldn't comp anything.  She never even asked for it, she just said I wasn't feeling well and probably wouldn't be eating my over salted undercooked steak (medium rare is a cool pink center, not raw and uncooked).  I'm not giving a bad review because I got sick or because they put a pound of salt on the steaks.  I'm giving them a bad review on how rude they were and made a big point to let everyone know that my sickness couldn't possibly be their fault.  I will definitely not be back.\",\n",
       " 'I was underwhelmed with this place. I ordered the prime rib from the prix fix menu, and it was okay, probably a solid B. It came with some sides--a small thing of creamy spinach, okay. A small thing of mac\\'n cheese, tasted pretty nasty. A small dish of steamed vegetables, mostly peas, probably from a can. \\n\\nThe potato bread was greasy as heck. Duck fat fries, also very greasy--nothing special, don\\'t listen to the other guys. In\\'n out has way better fries. Someone should tell the people cooking back there, more grease does not equal better tasting food. The dessert was really good, however (kudos to the dessert chef). That, and the hostess (kudos to the hiring staff) were about the only redeeming qualities.  \\n\\nI used a $50 restaurant.com coupon and still it seemed way expensive. This is more of an overpriced tourist joint for people who are staying in the hotel and don\\'t have cars. If you are stuck in Mandalay Bay, I would suggest Aureole or Lupo, both had better food. A short taxi ride away is McMullan\\'s Irish Pub next to the Orleans which also has better food (try the \"chips\").',\n",
       " 'I love steak but I think the truffle mac & cheese stole the show. Our group ordered the Kansas City strip and skirt steak. For our sides we had creamed spinach w/ bacon & truffled mac & cheese. They offered us the duck fat fries and a foccacia. I must show love to our server Alexis. Alexis was very friendly and made our visit that much more enjoyable. The only thing I would say could be better is if they kept the plate they served the steak on hot so that the steak can stay warm. I would definitely come back here for some steak and mac & cheese.',\n",
       " \"This place is amazing!!!\\n\\nI had dinner at StripSteak last weekend and I had an incredible time.  First, we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation because of all the UFC 100 traffic.  However, the hostess seated us promptly at a lovely side table.  After taking drink orders, our server brought us a potato focaccia on the house and it was soft, fluffy and so good!  But after just a couple of bites, the server returned with a trio of duck fat fries, also compliments of the chef.  On our visit, he sent over truffle fries with a truffle sauce, bbq fries with a bbq sauce, and garlic/herb fries with a herb ketchup.  All amazing.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we got the ribeye and the kurobuta pork.  First, the portions are enormous!  The pork came with collard greens and creamy grits.  It was all delicious.  Oh, and the ribeye!  It melted in my mouth!!!  We also had the truffle mac and cheese, corn with jalapenos, and creamed spinach.  Way too much food but it was all so tasty.\\n\\nAlso, unlike other posters, we received nothing but friendly and attentive service.  From the hostess to the sommelier and waiter, everyone was eager to make our experience.\\n\\nThis was one of the best dinners I've ever experienced.  Ever.  Do try it out when you have the chance.  You won't regret it!\",\n",
       " \"StripSteak was absolutely amazing.. I am in love with the duck fat french fries.. They bring them out to the table instead of bread, I would ask the server to bring two orders of the duck fat fries instead of the foccaia. I had the lobster pea soup which was amazing. I am slightly lactose intolerant  which was definitely accommodated. Our server had no problem finding out what ingredients were used in my soup to make sure I could eat it. I loved the fact that they left whole peas in the soup with gracious portions of lobster. I also had the fillet mignon which was to die for! All of their steaks are dry aged in house and cooked over a mesquite wood burner. I'll definitely be back to stripsteak soon! Another Michael Minna success!\",\n",
       " \"My first fancy schmancy meal in Vegas that wasn't a buffet!\\n\\nIt's near all the other fancy restaurants in Mandalay Bay.  The entrance is very open, glass windows that extend to the roof and you can see the whole restaurant just standing out side.  \\n\\nLarge cow carcasses hang from hooks in the fridge behind the glass by the kitchen.  I'm guessing these are the delicious ones that they'll be hacking off for my order.\\n\\nThe host is formal; he pulls out my chair, hands me a menu, and places a napkin in my lap for me.  Thanks guy.  I order the filet mignon (a la carte, as most of the menu items come), the beau orders the Fried chicken w/mac & cheese.  Meanwhile, compliments of the chef are 3 types of fries and corresponding sauces - Truffle, BBQ, and ketchup, as well as a small pan of potato foccacia.  The truffle fries won me over.  I could have eaten plenty more of those. \\n\\nHad I known that they were bringin out the fries and bread, I would have skipped ordering a side of asparagus, which had this citrussy glaze over it, bleh.  I didn't want it to be sweet :P  I also prefer my asparagus unpeeled; I think it's crispier that way.\\n\\nWell, onto the steak; wow! That was easily the most tender, juicy and flavorful steak I've ever experienced. Yes, experienced.  It was that good.  I didn't think i could handle 10 ounces of it, but it was THAT good, tender inside, crusty with steak rub/seasoning on the outside and very lean around the edges, I tried the beau's chicken, too.  Hyum :) Was it juicy!  \\n\\nAll in all, I was very pleased with our meal and the service.  I'd like to say I would return, but it was quite the expensive meal! Not that it wasn't worth it, but ... well, we're poor.\",\n",
       " 'Big thanks to restaurant.com for finally convincing me to come here.  Wife and I had the filet and ribeye along w/ scalloped potatoes and the spinach souffle.  Steaks were cooked perfectly...I usually end up taking home about half my ribeye but I literally inhaled this one..so damn good.  The spinach souffle was really good...never had anything like that before.  I also liked how they serve foccacia and fries as kind of a complimentary starter as opposed to the loaf of bread/rolls most places do.  Def gonna do mac n cheese next time.',\n",
       " \"They were nice enough to let us use two restaurant.com gift certificates, since we were planning to split our party of 4.  \\n\\nI had the rib-eye, cooked medium rare.  It was the best rib-eye I've ever had!  It was a little pricey, but what quality steakhouse isn't?  I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Vegas.  The staff was really friendly and attentive.\",\n",
       " 'Totally lucky that I came here.  First of all, I had won a few hundred dollars at the blackjack table so I was feeling especially generous.  So after I took my girlfriend to a show, I wanted to treat her to a nice dinner.  And this was the closest steakhouse near the show.\\n\\nThis place may be the best steak that I had ever tasted.  I ordered the ribeye which was very tender and seasoned to perfection. They did not overbutter their steaks like some other nice steakhouses.  \\n\\nAlso, they give you fries as instead of bread.  The fries are seasoned differently with various different dipping sauces.  I dont know if they do this anymore, but they did do this when I was here last. \\n\\nThe decor is typical of a fancy steak house, but I love the fact that they have some cuts of meat on display on windows.\\n\\nDrawback of course is the price, but hey, what do you expect..it is a fancy steakhouse.\\n\\nGreat steak, great sides, great everything.',\n",
       " \"I don't know if I can add much more then any of the other reviews. The food was outstanding. The fries were surprising and delicious. We had the prime rib, spinach souffle and bone marrow. Our friends shared some of their onion rings with us. Everything was made perfectly. You must try the truffle aioli dipping sauce. I could drink that straight it was so good. We only had budget for one really expensive meal for our Vegas vacation and we were not disappointed that we choose StripSteak.\\n\\nI will add this. It was obvious that we were not in the income bracket of their normal clientele but we never once felt talked down to or made to feel uncomfortable in any way by the staff. Our group of four ordered two entrees and shared them for obvious reasons and still there was no questioning or eye raising or hesitation from the waiter or host. A great experience.\",\n",
       " \"during my latest trip to lv, my friends and i came here for dinner one night. my first impressions upon being seated: the hosts are attractive, the decor is modern and dig the extended glass separators, and 'damn those complimentary fries look delicious'. the restaurant's open space does not make it a quiet evening, but that's not what i was looking for! i ordered the prime rib, cooked medium. i was a little concerned about the servings being small, but was pleasantly surprised upon it's arrival. the meat was cooked to perfection. although i was a little surprised with how it was charred at the bottom, as i never had prime rib like this. but it didn't stop me from finishing it. we all shared sides of the creamed corn, mac & cheese, and scalloped potatoes. all the sides were very rich, but delicious.\\n\\nbut what makes me a fan of this place is their service, and willingness to accept a couple of my requests. one of the chefs actually came by our table and asked how everything was. also - the day after, i received an email from one of the team members, ashley, thanking us for our dining experiences. that was a nice touch...\",\n",
       " 'My 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!\\n\\nParties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  With drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.\\n\\n* Trio of Duck Fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - This complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  A great way to start any meal!\\n\\n* Potato Focaccia - More complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although I found to be just okay, the Husband enjoyed it more. \\n\\n* Maine Lobster \"bacon-wrapped fritters\" ($17) - Skewered lobster with bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  A refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!\\n\\n* Roasted Beets \"burrata, walnut oil\" ($15) - The fresh Italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.\\n\\n* Filet Tartare \"american kobe filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread\" ($21) - Beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  Garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  So tastefully good, you don\\'t need or want the bread.  \\n\\n* Shabu Shabu \"american kobe beef, mushroom consomme\" ($24) - A pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  A quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.\\n\\n* Angus Beef Cap ($46) - We all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  I initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  Cutting into my beef, it was more medium and I was saddened.  A quick glance around the table, and I realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  Lucky for me, the Husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (That act alone makes him a keeper!)  Once I cut into my newly acquired beef, I was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  \\n\\n* Mac & Cheese \"truffled\" ($12) - Yes, it\\'s all that and a bag of chips.  So creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it\\'s all over! So yum!  Worth ordering on its own.\\n\\n* Scalloped Potatoes \"caramelized onion & goat cheese\" ($12) - The onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  \\n\\n* Potato Puree Trio \"lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish\" ($14) - My personal fave over the other potato dish.  With so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  Very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.\\n\\n* Creamed Corn \"jalapeno\" - I guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  A slight bit of heat from the pepper and it\\'s more creamy goodness.\\n\\n* Beignets \"Chocolate Pot de Creme, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, Madagascar Vanilla Creme Brulee\" - Take a spoon to the crème brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  Dipping wise, I liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.\\n\\n* Coconut Candy Bar \"Caramel Ice Cream, Toasted Almonds\" ($12) - A very fancy candy bar that\\'s super sweet, and perfect for sharing.\\n\\n* Cucumber Martini - Surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.\\n\\n* Cherry Caiprihana - The Husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.\\n\\nThe service at Strip Steak was probably among the best.  There\\'s a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  One of the more personal and better customer service experiences I\\'ve had in awhile.  Michael Mina obviously knows what he\\'s doing with his food and his staff.  It\\'s no wonder there\\'s a cult following of his restaurants.  They also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (Most restaurants in the casinos don\\'t have their own restrooms, so you\\'re forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  But there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.\\n\\nMy suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  With a party of five or more, it\\'s harder to share the appetizers and sides.  You\\'ll share an intimate culinary adventure with them!\\n\\n4.5 stars',\n",

       " \"What normally would have been an impressive steak experience was slighted, just a bit, by the fact that I kept comparing StripSteak with my recent visit to BLT http://www.yelp.com/biz/blt-steak-west-hollywood?q=brian+c  \\n\\nMost notably was how, like BLT, StripSteak provides an amuse bouche and bread serving complimentary.  I give the edge to StripSteak on the amuse bouche duck fat fries.  They were so good that we were salivating over the un-touched portion that the table next to us didn't finish.  And, although the bread was good, there something more unique about the popovers at BLT.\\n\\nAs for entrees, three of us chose the ribeye ($51 each), which had a good flavor due to the fat content, but made me rethink choosing it over the filet ($54), luckily I got a nice sample of the filet since it's owner couldn't finish it.  Edge to BLT.\\n\\nSides.  Edge to StripSteak.  We ordered three to share among the four of use.  Mac N Cheese ($12), Cream Corn ($13), and the Spinach Souffle ($12).  While we felt each was good, the Cream Corn was our least favorite with the Spinach Souffle being my most favorite.  And, we probably could have been fine with two sides since the portion of the sides were much larger in comparison to BLT. \\n\\nThree of us had drinks.  The service was attentive.  And, like BLT, since we declined dessert, we were provided with a complimentary treat, which was two small bags of chocolate caramel corn, which was good, but not was good as the pecan treats BLT has.  \\n\\nI know it's not necessarily fair to compare StripSteak with BLT, but  again I thought about the comparison during dinner.  \\n\\nI think StripSteak could have done a better job of designing the interior to give you the feel that you weren't inside a Casino, but rather a Michael Mina level restaurant. \\n\\nTotal, excluding tip, for the four of us was $304.84.\",\n",

I believe the hubby ordered a bone-in rib eye and I had the salmon because I had steak the previous night...yeah, yeah, I realize its a steakhouse!  My salmon was delish, but the hubbies steak was a lil too done. I told him to send it back, but he opted not too and just ate it instead. We shared the truffled mac & cheese, which was also a delight to eat! I don't remember if we got a dessert or not, but we definitely had another glass of wine. \\n\\nOverall, we got out of there just under $250 including tip and I think it was well spent!

Only, my similar experience occurred when I took my first bite of their complimentary seasoned fries with their special sauces did I realize that it was the beginning of a good thing.  I was impressed that they have manged to perfect french fries with garlic seasoning, bbq seasoning, and regular fries with a crispy outside and a soft center. \\n\\nBut, it wasn\\'t the fries that had me calling and texting all of my friends and family.  It was when I took the first bite of their special Bone-in 14 oz Filet Mignon that was the taste of perfection.

EVER!!  Our waitress, Rachel, informed us that it was rare for them to have bone-in filet mignon as their specials.  She recommended it over their American Wagyu and 30oz Porterhouse!!!  \\n\\nGranted that I have never paid $57 for a piece of meat a la carte, but I daresay that it was worth every penny of it!! mMmMm, it was soooo good!!  I can\\'t even describe into words how amazing this steak was, and I am a steak-lover!!  Every new bite of this steak was a surprise because I couldn\\'t believe how amazing it was, and it was a constant reminder of the flavorful amazing taste with each and every bite until the last piece.  \\n\\nI was a bit disheartened when my steak was near completion, since that meant that I didn\\'t have anymore left... despite how full I was.  Its like reading a really good book and not wanting to reach the last pages because one knew that it would over after those pages.  You didn\\'t want to reach the end of the book since it was soo good, one just wants to keep reading it.... just like how I wanted to keep eating.  It was THAT good!!!  Five stars all the way!!!  \\n\\nThe BF had their prix-fix $45 clam chowder, prime ribs with three sides, and their amazing chocolate beignets!!

Knowledgable about the menu and answered all our questions in the smallest mini dress you could find.

       " 'This was one of less than a handful of restaurants still open after 10pm when we wanted an after-show bite.  The ambiance seemed sophisticated and inviting, so we gave it a try.  Mind you, we were not intending a full meal so we ordered a couple of appetizers.  The first was a steamed and chilled lobster cocktail for $24.  When the waiter brought it to our table, it was a major disappointment.  On top of a huge mound of crushed ice was HALF of a lobster tail about 3.5\" long and ONE claw about the same length.  What happened to the other half and claw #2?  \\n\\nIf I was a waiter, I would be ashame to deliver such a dish!  Worse yet, the taste was very bland and slightly overcooked.  Then it was time for appetizer #2 of triangular cut lettuce about 1.5 inches long and covered with a small portion of minced crab and what-not.  This was their lettuce cup dish of crab, but if the size does not disappoint you, the lack of crab taste cerrtainly will.  The free french fries and skillet bread did not justify the $50 check (tip included)!  \\n\\nThis was my first and LAST experience with StripSteak.  I accept the fact that prices are higher in Las Vegas, but the food lacked taste and was definitely short on quantity.\\n\\nAt least throwing $50 into a slot machine provides entertainment!',\n",
       " 'Michael Mina has exploded.  Before you know it, he is going to have a restaurant in every major city in the country.  I\\'ve eating at several of his other restaurants so I had a good idea of what to expect.  However, this was the first time I\\'ve visited his steakhouses.  From a culinary aspect, I\\'ve always enjoyed his food.  However, the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable number.  I\\'ve always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because I feel like it cost a little more than its worth.  The amount of add-ons you get exceed reasonable.  With that being said, having an expensive restaurant in Vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.  So, with that in mind, my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy every savory bite.  \\n\\nAt a steakhouse, its a standard that I get the bone-in rib eye.  We went to StripSteak on a Thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm, which was great (we arrived at 9:45pm).  I ordered the American Kobe Tartare and it was delicious.  Very flavorful, not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.  An excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.  The steak I ordered was medium-rare and it was spot on.  The thickness of the cut is slightly smaller than say a rib eye cut at Delmonico\\'s.  So the edges of the cut were closer to medium than the center which was closer to medium-rare.  The tenderness of the steak was excellent.  An excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.  \\n\\nA steakhouse should be able to make great steak.  That is the norm.  To make great appetizers at a steakhouse, that isn\\'t necessarily a given.  I think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and \"other\" parts of the meal I\\'ve experienced was at David Burke\\'s Primehouse in Chicago.  At that steakhouse, it is more than just the steak.  StripSteak is pretty close but still a distant second to David Burke\\'s.  The thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a four-star on yelp is the scotch selection.  The selection of scotch is extensive and is well worth the visit for any aficionado.  On this night, I visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.  \\n\\nLastly, this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually serves true Japanese A5 wagyu.  They have two choices, filet and ribeye.  Both Bradley Ogden\\'s in Caesar\\'s Palace and SW steakhouse in the Wynn have a version of the filet and CUT in the Palazzo actually has two choices as well (filet and ribeye).  So this is one of the few amongst many traditional steakhouses.  It does provide more options.\\n\\nCons: \\nThe wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this review (9/13/09-ish).  I was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but everything that I wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection, although expansive, was expensive.

       " \"Sorry this review won't be too useful because I went there a few years back, but I have to put this one review in, just because how good this place is.  We ordered all steak, including two orders of the Kobe Beef (so they called it).  I don't know what they did to the Kobe beef, or maybe IT IS the REAL KOBE beef, because they really had that melt in your mouth beef texture, VERY GOOD! YUM!  StripSteak also have great fries, everyone on my table liked but I don't really remember how it taste like, it's just special, one of the specialty you have to have at this restaurant.  This place is definitely more expensive than most of the steak restaurants in LV, they even tell you it's about $110 per person averagely, but if you are looking to eat at a nice steak restaurant with great steak in Las Vegas regardless of the price, this place is the place to go!  Oh one more thing, don't get the Kobe beef hot pot thingy, it's not worth it, it's good, but not worth it.\",\n",

I came hear to eat at one of my favorites \"3950\" but when MGM bought Mandalay they replaced it with Stripsteak but while apprehensive i finally tried it. Awesome! \\nI miss 3950 but I really liked this place. The menu was full of things Ill go back for some day but the Kobe fillet and duck fries were pretty right on. Had the mac n\\' cheese and some sort of bourbon pudding thing for dessert. It was all without complaint. \\nThe wait staff was very attractive and very polite. \\nWent back to eat there about a year ago and couldn\\'t get a last minute reservation so tried the striphouse.....',\n",

       " \"So me and the bf checked this out on our recent Vegas trip.  Food was excellent!  The complimentary French fry trio was amazing, each type of French Fry comes with it's own sauce.  The bf had a steak and I had the Salmon.  I don't eat meat but his steak looked pretty good, he certainly seemed to be enjoying it.  My salmon was excellent and the roasted lemon that came with it was perfect to squeeze on the fish.  StripSteak has several side dishes to choose from and we ordered the Mac and Cheese based on our waiters recommendation.  The waiter said this was enough for 2 people, I'd have to say it was enough for at least 4 since we had the fries and entrees.  Dinner was amazing and unfortunatly we skipped dessert.  However we managed to roll back to our room a few places down and recover from our Food Comas.\\n\\nAlso this place is currently has gift certificates on Restaurant.com.  I got a $50 gc a while back when they were doing a 80% off promo and had no problem using this for our meal.\",\n",
       " \"Stripsteak, a steakhouse brought forth by the all-powerful Michael Mina, is rightfully located in the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino as the perfect Sin City restaurant. \\n\\nWhy do you ask? Stripsteak is a vegetarian and Kosher eater's hell, but to a carnivorous foodie, it is simply the Garden of Eden. It's a place where giant haunches of beef are hung up to age in a wall-to-floor ceiling glass case, not unlike a display at a natural history museum chronicling the stages of decomposition, or rather, the stages to one delicious steak. \\n\\nAnd the food, oh, the food. As I write this, my mind is wandering back to the memories from that deeply satisfying meal. \\n\\nFirst, I had the trio of duck fat fries--each fry was a dream, with a shatteringly crunchy, smoky shell and a fluffy interior. My friends and I fought over the truffled fries and light garlic aioli especially, but the BBQ dusted fries and the original were stellar as well.\\n\\nAnd if that wasn't enough, we also ordered their spinach souffle, as an attempt in incorporating some vegetables in our meal. The state-of-the-art souffle was placed on the table by the server with great care as to not deflate the impossibly high, cloud-like confection. Then, he took it to a even higher level by pouring a luxurious Parmesan cream sauce from a dainty saucer. Just as the Fairy Godmother transformed Cinderella into the belle of the ball, Mina transformed the dowdy spinach into a classic French beauty.\\n\\nBut even the beauteous spinach souffle couldn't hold a candle next to the Rib-eye, for that steak has been through rigorous training. First, it begins its epic journey in the aging room, where's it's kept in a moisture and temperature controlled room to slowly mature for a month. The chef then trims the the sides of beef with an expertise not unlike a plastic surgeon to remove all unsightly dried bits and excess fat before portioning it into perfectly formed steaks. The next step is crucial: the steak is then poached in butter. A big no-no in the Kosher community as they forbid the fraternizing of meat and diary, but in my world, a big OH YES. For the finishing touch, the Rib-eye is then charred in their 1,000 degree grill for that deep smoky sear. \\n\\nThe best part was that the steak came to our table au naturale. With steak this juicy and well-seasoned, there's no need for A-1.\\n\\nIt's impossible to fall into a deep food coma coming out from a meal there, but it's oh so worth it. A definite must-eat destination for my next Vegas trip!\",\n",

The steaks were seasoned perfectly and cut of meat were top quality.  The trio of fries were excellent.   Their sides were as advertised.

Also, it's a Michael Mina restaurant and I have been to his place in San Francisco and it was excellent. The ambiance is modern and open, but doesn't seem that classy to me.  The service was average.  The Caesar salads my date and I had were flavorless.  My steak was very fatty and expensive too.  The meat that I could eat from it was good.  The creme de brulee dessert was very good.  Overall, I would never go back especially for the price.  The fries they put on the side for free on the table are tasty and the bread is different.  It comes in a skillet and is good.  The aparagus and bake potato sides were like most steak restaurants, expensive and huge, but good.\",\n",

I called ahead about a week. No problem! They couldn't get us at one large table, but we were seated next to each other along the back wall across from the freezers. I was told this at the time of the reservation. \\n\\nThe service was excellent. My sister and Parents got a cheap bottle of wine(95 bucks). \\n\\nAppetizer of lobster in tempura with some kind of cream sauce was awesome!

Its different, my pops freaking loved it. \\n\\nThe main course!! I got the American Kobe (65 bucks) it was grub, super soft 8oz. Mom and brother in-law went for the rib eye. Get it off the prefix menu, Its 55 bucks for anything off the list. If you order the rib eye you pay 10 bucks more and get the same cut you would order of the a la cart! Excellent value!! My wife got a special cut, I don't know if they always have it, it wasn't on the menu.....it should be!! Bone in fillet Mignon!!! IT WAS BETTER THAN MY KOBE i think it was 58 bucks 14 oz with bone. My pops order the standard fillet mignon. Not as tender as the bone in, but excellent. The rest of the group ordered off the prefix, no one complained about the steaks being over cooked. \\n\\nSIDES, you only need one side for every 3 people!!! I personally tried a bunch of them and you cant go wrong with any!! Mac and Cheese is the best hands down. The rest are great, spinach, potatoes with caramelized onions were bad ass, peas were freaking unbelievable, they tasted like they were picked an hour ago!! Onion rings, well they were onion rings. \\n\\nDeserts were great!! everyone got the doughnuts that come with the prefix. I went for the 12 dollar cheese cake. It tasted like it was twelve bucks!! Caramelized black berries. Enough said! I wobbled back to the casino. \\n\\nAt the end of the night the bill for my family of 6 was about $700 bucks. \\nI am definitely going back there next time I am in Vegas.\",\n",
       " \"Tried their pre-fixe menu at the bar. Instead of prime-rib as advertised, I got a chewy fried steak - probably a New York or lesser cut. Though the crab cake was delicious, the potato wedges were bland and service was average at best on a very busy night. To top off a regrettable experience, the tip was automatically included in the bill despite only being a party of two. Worse, this 18% tip was assessed inclusive of the sales tax instead of just the food & drink - a pet peeve and tricky practice of these tourist traps. In the future, I'll stick with Ruth's Chris or Morton's which are a comparative bargain.\",\n",
       " \"Dinner was unbelievable. The restuarant itself is not set up how I would personally like- it seems sparse and tables/settings were plain to the point of feeling cold. All these thoughts melted away, however, when the complimentary duck fat fries arrives. Three uniquely seasoned fries with accompanying sauces. They were perfectly crisp and delicious. I ordered al a carte and has the Foie Gras sliders to start. Great little sliders with a generous amount of sweetness from peach preserves and the foie was perfectly cooked. For my main I had the American wagyu ribeye cap. This steak was fatty and delightful in only the way waguy can be. It blew my mind and while I think of myself as an accomplished steak eater, this 8oz portion was nearly too much. Its richness and lush flavor was enhanced by the way stripsteak cooked it. For a side, we shared their mashed potatoes- three ways. They were extremely rich, but oh so good! \\n\\nMy better half enjoyed the 3-course predetermined menu. He had no complaints other than his truffled mac and cheese was much too truffle-y, which I agreed. \\n\\nStripsteak is pretty typical Las Vegas steakhouse. No real surprises, but they provide consistent high caliber steaks night after night. The prices are high and there's no way to get around that. If you dine there, I recommend splurging on American kobe. Its not much more expensive than their prime and the steak you will receive will be an experience all in of itself.\",\n",
       " \"This is a fantastic, modern steak-house. I ate here for dinner recently during a visit to Vegas for a friends Birthday. The service here is outstanding---everyone is friendly, helpful, and on the ball. They even gave my friend (the birthday boy) a Birthday note. Additionally, the manager sent me a follow up email the next day to thank my party for the visit! \\n\\nOn to the meal: we were given two free appetizers---french fries cooked in duck fat, with various dipping sauces, and warm bread with rosemary. Both delicious! I ordered off the pre-fix menu (appetizer, entree and desert for $55) and had the crab soup, rib-eye steak, and creme broule---all delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. The Bday boy had the Kobe burger and also said it was fantastic. My boyfriend had the filet mignon, which he said was great. One of the best parts of the meal was the mac n' cheese the Bday boy ordered as a side dish. I highly recommend ordering this treat---it will be hard to return to that old staple, Kraft, after you have eaten this!! \\n\\nOverall: GREAT STEAK, friendly service, beautiful atmosphere!\\n\\nTip: I had a restaurant.com $50 gift certificate that we used towards our meal. Restaurant.com often has sales, and gift certs are generally 60-80% off. Thus, I got my $50 gift cert. for $4! Good deal!

Great food at a good price.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable. We were seated quickly and our waiter was super attentive. The complimentary trio of duck fat fries was diviiiine, especially the truffle oil fries. We were also given some focaccia bread as well, but we didn't touch it, unfortunately. My boyfriend got their famous Kansas City Strip (voted #1 steak by Esquire magazine) with scalloped potatoes, and I ordered the American Kobe Rib Eye with seared foie gras. My Kobe Rib Eye was cooked just the way I like it on the inside (a delicate red medium rare), but a little too charred on the outside. The foie gras was the same, too charred on the outside, but melt in your mouth amazing otherwise. My boyfriend wasn't so lucky; his Kansas City Strip was overcooked. We were tempted to send it back, but we typically try not to do that too much. We were both very disappointed, as this was their famous dish after all. The scalloped potatoes were well cooked, but too much on the creamy side for our liking. All in all, it was a so-so food experience.\\n\\nI would say 4.5 stars for service.\\n2 stars for food.\\nan overall 3 stars, because we didn't have to pay the full $200 for something that was worth $50\\nThis is a definite non-repeat.\",\n",

((Mmmmghghgh))\\n\\nMy friend and I shared a Porterhouse with some King Crab... It was nearly a religious experience. The steak was so tender, I could've sworn it simply fell apart in my mouth.

It needed absolutely no further seasoning and was cooked perfectly. The King Crab, well, it was good, but then again King Crab is fairly consistent from place to place. \\n\\nPricey?

It's nice to see a restaurant take something simple and class it up a bit.\\n\\nFor an appetizer I had the bacon-wrapped lobster fritters.  I already knew that bacon makes everything taste better but I didn't know it could make lobster taste that much better.\\n\\nMy date had the spinach souffle with parmesan cream which she absolutely loved.  I had the bone-in rib-eye which was absolutely excellent.  The steaks here a first poached in butter and then cooked over a wood-burning grill.  I hadn't had steak prepared in this manner before but it was excellent, one of the more memorable steaks I've ever had.\\n\\nBig thumbs up for this place.\",\n",
       " 'If you\\'re like my husband and I, you LOVE comfort food. Creamy goat cheese and caramelized onion scalloped potatoes? Duck fat fries with truffle cream? Creamed spinach infused with bacon? If you\\'re salivating already, Stripsteak is the place for you.\\n\\nWe made reservations for a Friday through the concierge at the Mandalay Bay (the StripSteak website said they were booked) but we were able to get an 8:30pm table for two the day of. The restaurant is located on \"restaurant row\" of the Mandalay in-between the casino and convention center. We arrived right on time for our reservation were seated right by the window. I recommend doing the same because it\\'s perfect for people watching since everyone LOVES to stop and fondle the giant marble breasts across the way. (Ridiculously funny.)\\n\\nTo start things off, I ordered a Patron Margarita and Russ ordered a man-tini. We went to work pouring over the menu. We quickly discovered it was perfect for anyone who loves modern american comfort food.  As soon as we sat down our (extremely nice and helpful) waiter brought us out a complimentary order of Duck Fat fries - which we were happy to munch on while we made our decision.\\n\\nSpend your money wisely and invest in the $60 Kobe Rib Cab which was the best cut of steak I\\'ve had in a VERY long time.  It\\'s 8ozs of deliciousness. I got mine medium and am happy to report it was juicy, full-flavored, and melt-in-your-mouth good. Russ\\'s Porterhouse was also extremely tasty, but if you\\'re willing to pay more for the quality - go for the Kobe beef selection. It was unreal and worth every $5 bite.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Milk Chocolate mousse which was the perfect way to end our meal. It was sweet and smooth, but not too heavy  -- we left feeling happy and full.  I asked the bartender to prepare me a special desert cocktail that would go with our desert and he made a delicious chocolate raspberry martini that I rocked till the last drop.\\n\\nTo those of you reading this on your Yelp app deciding what to do for dinner tonight or later this week on the Strip, look no further.\\n\\nI *Highly* recommend this one especially if you love warm, delicious comfort food that actually tastes amazing.',\n",

Allow me to illustrate....\\n\\n1.  Trio of Duck Fat Fries - These were mutha beepin\\' good!  Loved the bbq flavor fries.

Sashimi (albacore, bigeye, blue fin toro) - The worst decision ever.  We were greedy and thought that \"Hey, we\\'re at an expensive restaurant.  It has to be good right?\"  Boy, were we wrong!  The albacore was icy?  WTF?  The tuna was fishy.  AND.  AND!  The toro was so fibrousy.\\n2.  Bibb Wedge (Salad) - Standard blue cheese, iceberg and bacon.  Yum.\\n3.  American Kobe Ribeye - Good but not juicy.  (Del Frisco\\'s and N9NE still win)\\n4.  Slow Poached Prime Rib - Not juicy, not super tender.  *tear\\n5.  Truffled Macaroni and Cheese!  - Another mutha beepin\\' good one.  Trufffleeee.... *pump fist.\\n\\nConclusion:  I beepin\\' loved the fries and mac n cheese.  I will dream of them.

I can make a better steak myself. I've had a better steak at Cattlemens' . I've probably had a better steak at Applebee's! Maybe not. Anyways, I ordered the American Kobe ribeye. I wish the waitress told me that it didn't include the rib cut. That was so, so disappointing! I couldn't believe it! $64 for a rough piece of meat. Cooked medium rare, but still damn tough.

They were good fries but did not understand all the hype.  Next I ordered the crab cake appetizer.  2 pcs filled with dungeness crab fried up like a hush puppy.. It was decent but nothing spectacular.  I found too many shell fragments in the crab cake.  Maryland style crab cakes are way better.  For the main course I ordered the 6 oz Japanese A5 NY Strip, grillled Foie Gras, and Truffled Mac & Cheese.  The steak was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  It came with a Yuzu dipping sauce on the side which added nothing to the steak.  The one thing I didn't like was that it was way over seasoned.

So when searching for a place with an innovative approach to steak, StripSteak should have been a no brainer, right?\\n\\nAs it turned out, StripSteak was a bit of a letdown. The reason, however, is a little hard to pin down.

That said, because they bring them out to every table, while lying in wait for their next victim, the fries don\\'t come out as hot and fresh as they could be. In addition to the fries, they also bring out to your table a cast iron pan of potato focaccia bread, which was delicious but dense. All this before even getting our appetizers!\\n\\nFor our meal, we both opted for the prix fixe menu, which is a fair deal at $55.\\n\\n1st Course\\n\\nMaryland Blue Crab Chowder | Bacon Lardon, Parsnip -- Intense crab flavor but a little watery. Not my favorite.\\n\\nBibb Wedge | Avocado, Bacon, Oregon Smokey Blue  -- Good flavor, but I felt like I have had this before. Surprisingly staid for Michael Mina. In fact, both these dishes were really underwhelming.\\n\\n2nd Course\\n\\nSlow-Poached Prime Rib of Beef | Select Seasonal Side Dishes -- The meat was well cooked, but honestly, I have made better prime rib at home. The side dishes consisted of a wonderful brussels sprouts slaw, a predictable truffled mac and cheese, and an insipid creamed spinach.\\n\\nDry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye ($10 surcharge) -- This was delicious, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor.

And this is the reason I brought the 2006 Scarecrow Cabernet Sauvignon ($35 corkage), which paired perfectly with the meat.\\n\\n3rd Course\\n\\nMichael\\'s Root Beer Float | Sassafras Ice Cream, Chocolate Chip Cookies  -- Pure yum! I could have had a pitcher of this.\\n\\nFinally, as if this wasn\\'t enough, before you leave and write your Yelp review, they present you with a bag of Chocolate Almond Brittle. Again, a bribe.\\n\\nThe service was for the most friendly and unpretentious, with the exception of the person who came to open and decant our wine (I don\\'t think he was the somm). He seemed a little snotty and did not smile at all.\\n\\nSo would I come back again? Probably not, but I did enjoy some aspects of our meal. The next time I\\'m in Las Vegas and want to do a Michael Mina restaurant, I\\'ll head to Nobhill Tavern instead.',\n",

It was very hard to decide what to get it was between slow pouch prime rib or the Kansas City steak. I went with the Kansas City steak (18 ounces). I order my steak med-rare just love to taste the meat. My wife ordered the Skirt steak (8 ounces) med-rare. The sides were very delicious I ordered Mac and cheese and the wife ordered the scallop potatoes. I must say this was a grand meal very very mesmerizing.',\n",
       " \"Simply Delicious! I eat at StripSteak on every trip to Las Vegas. It's a very unpretentious steakhouse that serves great food consistently. Yes it can be a bit noisy because it is very popular and the layout is very open. The staff has always been very accommodating. The complimentary fry trio you get upon being seated is a nice teaser but they like to tell you they are compliments of the chef. Ha ha nice try. Everyone gets these and has been for years, they are now the equivalent of chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant. I will however never refuse them, they are yummy. If you aren't a big steak eater the chicken is amazing and just the right size. If you get a side of the Mac& cheese it's extremely rich and satisfying. The lobster fritters are very pricey but unique and tasty, I get them every time. It's a perfect appetizer that will not fill you up and a great start before a meal.\",\n",

The food was great, the atmosphere was nice. \\n\\nMy only complaint was the volume of the music. It was so difficult to understand what my friends with accents were saying because the background music was so loud. I was literally concentrating so hard on trying to read their mouths the whole time that it could have ruined the overall experience if the food had not been so good.\\n\\nI will definitely be back for their Roasted Beets with Burrata Cheese...it was sooo good!

The wine selection was good. The service was just slow.  The waiter acted as if he was doing us a favor to wait on us.  It gets two stars only for the nice atmosphere.

The waitress was terrible, took about half an hour to take our orders and hardly came to visit us.  The steak does not compare to other prime steakhouses.  I'm not sure what the fuss is about the fries on these reviews, they are just regular fast food like fries with different dips.

The restrooms are unisex and it is very modern chic.  Very pricey and cost is always close to $300, but that's because of the alcohol.

I had the bone-in rib-eye and it tasted like Costco steak...which taste good....but not $51 for 18oz good. My Gf had the American Wagyu....terrible! No marblization no flavor punch...just another eye of rib taste. Ive had both \"Dry-aged\" bone-in rib-eye and Kobe steak before and the steaks at strip steak do not even near the realm of the taste you encounter when eating the true stuff....sooo dissappointed.\\n \\nLobster tail not at all fresh or worth the price. Roasted Mushrooms tasted too wierd...also too expensive as well. Scalloped potatoes...barely OK. Merlot Excellent! Their Focaccia bread thing was a heart-breaking waste of dough. Roasted Bone marrow was OK. French fries was your basic multy times fried re-hash fries...SUCK...BUT the sauces was Good & seasoning good!\\n \\nAll in all, just too over-priced for the type of food...the food served here is the same level as Outback steak house....Please believe me, i am not even joking. Please save your money and buy 3 ribeyes for $22 at costco....same taste...trust me! I wish this place did work out for us but sadly it failed horribly. WHats worse than that was the websites that i looked at that actually said that stripsteak was good dry-aged steak. i feel like the credibility of these websites is shot. Sounded like these guys knew what they were talking about...oh well....THANK GOD that we had the Restaurant.com coupon or i would have been a lot more angry at what i could have paid for this substandard experience! I would rather go to Ruth Cris and get a \"Wet-Aged\"  Bloodyish tasting piece of beef than this place, at least Ruth Cris\\' steak taste better for less and their sides are way better too....Yup....thats how dissappointing Stripsteak is : (',\n",

FANTASTIC service.\\n\\nthe trio of fries were delish...but we tried so hard not to eat all of it for fear of not being able to finish our main course.  the truffle mayo was exquisite...and it was dang hard not to soak up every single fry in it.  the fresh out of the oven rosemary focaccia bread was WOW.  i didn't even get a chance to take a picture of it cause we just dove right in.  it was buttery, warm, and so good that after a couple of pieces, i found myself not trying to look at it or else i'd devour the rest of it.  \\n\\nboth of us ordered off the prix fixe menu which was well worth the pricetag of $55 each.  don't forget your restaurant.com gift certificate which takes 50 bucks off your bill!  we took advantage of the discount and decided to order an appetizer...so we got meat at its purest level...the kobe filet tartare.  man oh man...if i could, i'd skip everything else on the menu and just order 3 of those for myself.  the server came to our tableside with a plate of the diced kobe, a quail egg, and seasonings.  he mixed the tartare right in front of us explaining every single ingredient and placed the mixture into a bowl with ice.  it was served with some pita bread.  the tartare itself was enough to give this place 5 stars...the quality of the kobe was amazing!  a must try when you come here...\\n\\nnow the first course...wifey had the crab chowder while i chose the bibb salad.  the server said that every bowl of crab chowder is made to order.  the chunks of crab in the bowl were generous...and the broth itself was super tasty.  but my salad...mMmmm...i absolutely love blue cheese...and my salad had 2 different types.  wifey gave me the stink face though but was still willing to try it.  yummy!!!\\n\\nwe both decided to order the slow poached prime rib...who wants to order chicken from a steak house?  the server warned us that ordering medium guarantees you medium rare...which was perfect for us.  so medium it is!!!  the prime rib was super tasty and tender.  no juices splattered over the plate which means that the chef knew what the heck he was doing.  it was served with a side of delish au jus and creamy horseradish.  our entree also came with 3 sides...peas and carrots, truffled mac n cheese, and bacon creamed spinach.  i left the peas and carrots alone since they weren't anything special...and devoured the rest of the side dishes.  the truffled mac n cheese was OMG good.  don't truffles just make everything that much better?  yum.  \\n\\nand then dessert...root beer float with sassafras ice cream and root beer sorbet...served with chocolate chip cookies baked to order...oh, and a chocolate straw.  the server was nice enough to even put a candle on wifey's plate and happy birthday written with chocolate.  before we tried our dessert, we had to ask ourselves...how good can a root ber float possibly be?  haha.  this root beer float was of course, the best root beer float i have ever had.  amazingness.\\n\\nloved this place...can't wait to try michael mina's other restaurants...i've heard great things about his lobster pot pie.  yummy!\",\n",

The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He took several pictures of the group at our request and was patient as we gave him 5 different cameras to take pictures with.  The whole time he cracked jokes and told us he would take as many pictures as we wanted....+1 in my book for the service.\\n\\nOriginally, we had a reservation for 15 people but 4 didn't make it, so the hostess had to rearrange the table.  The hostess came to get us 10 minutes after our original reservation time....not bad for a last minute change like that.\\n\\nWe were seated and our server immediately asked me if we wanted the wine list and who were the wine drinkers in the group.  I gave her the headcount and instructed her to keep our wine glasses full until I said stop.  She obliged and went to get the wine.  I ordered a Malbec from Argentina, it was nice and earthy with hints of blackberry & pepper....perfect! +1 for the wine.\\n\\nThe server made several recommendations for the group and we placed our order.  As a complimentary appetizer, they brought out a tray of 3 different flavors of French Fries.  From what I could tell the flavors were BBQ, Plain, and Garlic & Herbs....served with 3 dipping sauces....BBQ, Horseradish, Ketchup.  They were good, the Garlic & Herbs was the best of the 3.\\n\\nWhen the food came out, it was presented beautifully on the plates and cooked exactly how we all ordered it.....that's rare for a group this large.  Normally there is one or two that has to send it back because it wasn't cooked right, but not tonight!  I had the 10 oz Filet and ordered it Medium Well.....it was tender and the knife sliced through it like butter.  It had a nice juicy flavor with a smokey & peppery finish.....a great pairing for the Malbec...nom nom nom!  +1 on the Steaks.  I took a few pics of the Steaks for foodie viewing pleasure.\\n\\nFor a side dish, I ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese....again, great pairing for the entree....I highly recommend it.  The Asparagus was good too.\\n\\nNobody had any room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the dinner was a big hit with everyone.\\n\\nWill I return?

       " \"TIP: Sometimes they have $50 certificates on restaurant.com.\\n\\nWhile we were seated promptly, I felt our waiter was a bit slow to take our order and check up on us from time to time. Also, I had to ask if they had a prix fixe (knowing about it while researching the restaurant online beforehand) before he gave us the prix fixe menu. Not sure if that's normal or not. \\n\\nMaybe this is a conspiracy, but these guys serve duck fat fries seasoned 3 ways with 3 types of dipping sauces instead of bread. These thing are fantastic and most likely if you do not control yourself you will get full off these things. That's just my theory. Either way, out of a group of 7, 4 ordered off the prix fixe menu, one got the kobe burger, one a wagyu steak, and one the pork loin. Everything was cooked very well and tasty to boot. I had the 18oz bone-in ribeye off the prix fixe menu, along with the iceberg lettuce salad. The salad was surprisingly good. The steak was large and juicy. It also came with 3 seasonal side dishes served in individual serving plates. I also ate half of the kobe burger, which was very good as well. The rootbeer float dessert was also quite satisfying.\\n\\nAll in all, a very nice meal food wise at an upscale steakhouse.\",\n",

Her wine recommendation, which I think was the house cabernet sauvignon, was fantastic. I had the kobe ribcap, my other dinner mates had the kobe ribeye, filet mignon, and scallops. My steak was cooked nicely med-rare, and tasted amazing with fantastic marbling. However, it seemed like the other steaks were cooked just a bit less than requested. You can taste the mesquite wood flavor in the meat, although I didn't think it enhanced the flavor too much. The starter duck fat fries are excellent, as is the foie gras slider appetizer. The truffle mac and cheese is a must try. The mushrooms were a little salty (maybe they're supposed to be), but had good mushroom flavor. At the end of the meal, we were too stuffed to try any desserts, but their coffee was a perfect finish to a very nice meal.\",\n",

Our waitress suggestd that we take off the top piece of bread so we could taste the foie gras more. Good call on the bread! I think if I had eaten it with the bread on top, the taste would have overwhelmed the foie gras. It had a slightly sweet sauce taste but it was delicious! It only comes in two small pieces though. \\n\\nI'm a HUGE fan of prime rib so I ordered this without even thinking. However, they cook prime rib really different here. I wish my waitress warned me because I wasn't a fan. She later told me that people either loved it or hated it. Thanks, you could have warned me :( There's a certain taste that you expect when you eat prime rib but this place didn't have it. But like she said, other people would love it.\\n\\nThe rib eye was pretty tasty, cooked well. The sides of truffle mac & cheese was delicious but extremely rich. The spinach was okay. \\n\\nThe root beer float dessert was a nice finish to the meal. Tastes exactly like what you would make for yourself as a kid but that feeling of nostalgia and the fact that it's not a heavy dessert was a nice touch. \\n\\nI probably wouldn't come back since there's so many other places to try but the meat definitely looks promising.

Each meal is started off with a trio of Duck Fat Fries, compliments of the Chef. Duck Fat Fries are french fries which are fried in duck fat , seasoned three different ways and served with three dipping sauces. These are easily the best french fries i\\'ve ever had are deserving of the 5-star rating alone. \\n\\nCollectively, our group ordered the Japanese A5 Filet (market price of $95), a few orders of Salmon ($35), the American Kobe Burger ($25), and additional sides of duck fat fries and the truffled mac and cheese. While the prices are high, this is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for.\" We were told that the A5 filet was flown in from Japan earlier that morning, and upon receiving it, was tender enough to cut with a fork alone.  \\n\\nThe Salmon, cooked and seasoned perfectly, was extremely fresh. Having eaten at places such as Neptune\\'s Net on Pacific Coast Highway in California, I didn\\'t think it was possible to taste a fresher tasting fish, but Stripsteak really nailed it. When served with a side of truffled Mac & Cheese, which might i add was some of the best i\\'ve had the pleasure of trying, it was truely an adventure for the taste buds.\\n\\nOnto the burger. The American Kobe Burger was the least expensive of the various options. It featured a kobe beef patty cooked to a perfect medium served on a bun with fennel slaw and watercress. What was without a doubt the best burger i\\'ve ever had was served alongside a second helping of the succulent duck fat fries I had experienced at the beginning of our meal. \\n\\nOverall, i was very pleased with the meal as well as the amazing service and I didn\\'t hear a single complaint in our party except regarding the price. But like I mentioned earlier, \"you get what you pay for.\" Unless of course you were the one ordering the $95 A5 filet... That should have come with a lapdance.',\n",

The waiters started us out with duck fat fries, compliments of the chef (we weren't special they gave them to every table).  I have to say I was underwhelmed.  I have heard so many people say oh duck fat fries are soooo good...um they tasted like regular fries.  Maybe my taste buds just aren't distinguished enough, but no one at the table was raving about them.\\n\\nWe then ordered several appetizers, the crab cakes were way more crab that cake!  That's a rarity in my opinion!  I also ordered bacon wrapped fried lobster meat with a cream fresh dipping sauce.  It was so good, I didn't want to offer them to anyone else but being generous I did, and unfortunately they took me up on my offer!  \\n\\nFor my main course I ordered the hand massaged Kobe 6 oz steak.  It was super tender and delicious....could I really tell that it was a Kobe steak, not really, but it was really good.  We also ordered the truffle mac and cheese, if you dont like truffle oil dont order this because it is very strong in the dish.

At first one of the waitresses kept filling up our waters every two or three sips, literally-and then we figured out why. Every single dish-EVERY SINGLE DISH-was insanely salty!!! Not just the apps, but the duck fat fries, the foccacia, the truffeled mac and cheese, even the steaks!! Don't get me wrong-the food was good.

The prime rib was not the best but I wouldn't be too hard to critique based on that because I'm sure they aren't known for their prime ribs. The short ribs were very tender. I ordered a side of jalepeno cream corn which I thought was very good. \\n\\nI really wanted a dessert but the dessert choices were quite slim. Nothing sounded to really pop. I ended up choosing a chocolate mouse with red velvet chunks on top. It was good. The service was pretty fast throughout the whole dinner and I really liked at the end they leave you with a bag of caramel popcorn dipped in chocolate sauce for you to take home!\",\n",
       " 'Ate here again recently, and had the Filet. It was perfect. Very good. And the trio of fries they give you before the meal are all excellent. Probably the best fries I have ever had.',\n",
       " \"this was our second time eating here and it was just as good as last time.  as mentioned they give you the fries and a type of bread for appetizer, so i really don't see a point to ordering an appetizer when they give you two.  i had the kansas city steak which was just the best thing i ate all vacation long.  it's a very reliable steak.  i wanted to try something different but i knew how good it was last time and wanted to make sure that i was going to get something good.  it was cooked absolutely perfect.  my wife had the scallops which were really good as well.  entrees run in the 40 -60 dollar range.  side dishes are 9-12 dollars.  we opted for dessert and went with the root beer float which comes with a couple fresh baked cookies.  its not on the dessert menu.  it was good, but i don't feel $12 was worth the size.  but overall it was a really nice experience, really delicious dinner.  we used our restaurant.com gift certificate to take $50 off the bill.  if you can get your hands on one of those it really makes it a much much more affordable meal.  over half the restaurants in mandalay bay are on restaurant.com so take advantage of it.\",\n",

I had the 10oz Filet Mignon (Medium Rare) and it was cooked to PERFECTION. I think that was the best cooked steak I\\'ve ever had. Melted in my mouth like butter!\\n\\nFor sides, we had the Potato Puree Trio, Spinach, and roasted mushrooms. The spinach wasn\\'t anything special, but the roasted mushrooms were great. The potato puree was a little \"pureed\" for me, and maybe I had a little bit too much alcohol in me, so it didn\\'t sit quite well in my stomach--but it was ok. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had a trio of ice cream (chocolate ice cream was amazingggg), strawberry shortcake (really good), a blueberry custard (this is good if you\\'re not into anything overly sweet), and some sort of chocolate concoction.

The fries were absolutely delicious (I'm not saying this because it was free). They were really good. You get 3 generous portions of Spicy Fries, Truffle Fries, and Parmesan Fries. DO NOT eat the complimentary bread - save your appetite so you can finish your entree & sides. --Fries 4.5 / 5 Stars....Bread 1 / 5 Stars\\n\\nAged Bone In Rib Eye ($52) - 18 oz of delicious Rib Eye.

My girlfriend ordered this because we wanted to try a slightly higher quality meat without burning a hole in our wallet. IMO it will be enough for most people. We also shared each others steak just in case she wanted more meat, but it was more than enough.  The steak was cooked perfectly (Medium Rare)!\\n--5 / 5 Stars\\n\\nCream Corn w/ Jalepeno - Absolutely delicious. The presentation may fool as you because the photos don't look aesthetically appealing. But the pictures can't do this dish any justice - you just have to try it! Creamy, slight kick of mild spiciness from the Jalapeno. Enjoyable with every bite! \\n--5 / 5 Stars\\n\\nMac & Cheese w/ Truffle - Again like the Cream Corn, photos can not do this dish any justice. The truffle and mac & cheese definitely ranked in my top 3 of mac & cheese of all time. I only prefer to eat Mac & Cheese w/ Truffle and this was an automatic home-run in my ball park.\\n--5 / 5 Stars\",\n",

The burger was decent, but I have had better American Kobe burgers. The burger does have some of spread or aioli on it that after tasting would have rather had on the side. On the bright side, the burger does come with another pile of those fries. The tomato soup is pretty good. It definitely has the heirloom tomato taste so the the soup is a little bitter. The lobster grilled cheese triangles are small, but tasty.\\n\\nMy date ordered the fried chicken, but was bummed to find out that they only fry it for parties or 2 or more. Single fried chicken eaters have to opt for the grilled breasts instead. The truffle mac and cheese was just fair. \\n\\nThe desserts were pretty good as we shared the creme brulee and root beer float. The root beer float is not on the regular menu, but the waitress brought one to us anyway. I had seen a few of them go by and it sounded tasty.

The flavor was not rich either, which left me wondering if the steak was even dry-aged like the waiter said, and if it really was aged for the time period they stated.

(medium-rare plus!) after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the rib-cap: the robust flavor of the rib-eye, the tenderness of a filet, and the mouth-melting fat of pork belly. a trifecta worth the $60. the sides were awesome, but i couldn\\'t stop loving each bite of my steak.\\n\\nkaty checked in, and i was impressed that the product delivered. she noticed my can of pale ale was out, and suggested i try an ipa. wine just wouldn\\'t do with this steak, and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl. i mentioned to the server extraordinaire, that the only problem i had with the rib-cap was after the first bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth, the excitement of the next bite was slightly diminished. \\n\\nkaty went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of intermezzo, palate cleanser. so my last bite was just like my first.',\n",
       " 'This was the 4th meal of the recent \"Vegas Food Tour\" that me and my other half decided to embark on. We LOVED this place. This was easily the best steakhouse we have ever eaten at! This place gives you a truly American vibe as soon as you walk through the door. From the dimmed lighting to the wooden table/chairs to the paper place mat, this was definitely American. Don\\'t get me wrong though, this place is still very fancy. Not to mention all the freebies they give out! First freebie was the Duck Fat Fries which were... indescribably delicious. Don\\'t take all the other review for granted, they are all completely accurate!  Second freebie, was the pizza bread. I wasn\\'t really a fan of this, it was just way too dense and dry for my liking, and not to mention filling. I wanted to save my stomach for the STEAK. The third freebie we got was from our waiter Steve, at the end of the meal he gave us two packs of caramel/chocolate covered popcorn to enjoy during our Mystere show we were going to after dinner, very nice gesture, and we of course tipped him accordingly. =)\\n\\nWith all the freebies we got we decided to go ahead and skip the appetizers and go straight for wine. I ordered a Red Syrah Wine from Sonoma (I think) and she ordered a Pinot Noir (location unknown), I thought both were good, but we ended up switching because she felt that the Pinot was tasteless and I thought it was light and amazing.\\n\\nMeat:\\nWe were actually intending to get the Japanese Wagyu but according to Steve they won\\'t be carrying it for another few months due to a MAD COW breakout in Japan. BOO MAD COW! Regardless, the American Wagyu did not disappoint. I suckered her into getting the American Kobe Rib Eye and I got the Rib Cap. FYI: the Rib Cap is 10 TIMES better than the Rib Eye. The steaks were perfectly cooked to our specifications, Medium Rare. Both pieces of meat were delicious but the marbling of the fat in between the crevices of meat in the Rib Cap made it that much more easier to melt in your mouth than the Rib Eye. But please don\\'t take it the wrong way, the Rib eye was still one of the best Rib Eyes I have ever had. \\n\\nSides:\\nWe ended up getting two sides and sharing, which was more than enough. We got the truffled mac and cheese and the jalapeno creamed corn. We already made our decision that we were getting the truffled mac because of all the reviews. One word described this dish... BOLD. The flavor was bold and I liked it but I could only have so much. The jalapeno creamed corn on the other hand I could have probably ate the whole bowl. It was a perfect combination of creaminess with a hint of spice to give it a kick. It was very very very good.\\n\\nDessert:\\nWe got the Beignets with creme brulee. The beignets came out warm with dusted powder sugar on top. And the creme brulee was well... creme brulee, nothing too special. It was a delicious end to our meal nonetheless.\\n\\nThis is a definite must eat at spot in Vegas. We were torn between Cut and StripSteak and I think we made the right decision. Next time we are getting the Japanese Wagyu!!',\n",
       " 'Over hyped!\\n\\nPicked this place for dinner with some friends because of the great reviews on here but I felt like I was tricked. \\n\\nThe complimentary trio of duck fat fries were okay, the middle one actually had a weird after taste that I didn\\'t like. The complimentary potato foccacia bread was stale, I was only able to manage a small bite out of it. So for starters, the two complimentary items failed in my book.\\n\\nThen came the main course. One of my friends and I shared the lamb which our waiter had recommended. They split it up onto two plates for us which was nice and actually, the lamb was pretty good. I\\'m not sure if it was really good or if it was just the best out of what I tried that night. I definitely had better lamb before though but this one was not bad. I ordered it medium rare and it came out just right. The mac-n-cheese that our waiter said was \"amazing\" was far from it. It was alright, tastes like mac-n-cheese I could make from a box. What I really didn\\'t like was the broccoli in it. The broccoli flavor overpowered the mac-n-cheese in my opinion. Definitely not \"amazing\".  \\n\\nTwo of my friends ordered steak and one ordered the smoked salmon. She said it was alright but couldn\\'t finish it because it wasn\\'t that good. She was actually sick the next morning. \\n\\nThis restaurant was definitely not the experience I was expecting based on the other reviews. The service was slow and the food was nothing special. If I\\'m going to pay that much for dinner I expect everything to taste good if not great. Definitely pass and go to Craftsteak instead.',\n",
       " \"We returned to Stripsteak over the weekend to use a restaurant.com $50 GC. I'm glad we had the excuse to return. This second visit was better than our first. The menu has been revamped a bit since then.\\n\\nWe had focaccia and duck fat fries to start. They were tasty just like before. This time we also had lobster fritters. They were flavorful bites, tender lobster wrapped in bacon and fried. Hard to go wrong there. Next up was lamb and short rib with sides of creamed jalapeno corn and shallot potato cakes. It was all nicely presented and well prepared. All in all, it was a very yummy meal.\",\n",
       " \"Wow. I know Vegas has dozens of great restaurants and it is so tempting to try them all, but I have no issue foregoing a new place next time to return to STRIPSTEAK. I was recently in LV staying at THEhotel and visited STRIPSTEAK on consecutive days. \\n\\nWe actually stopped in for the Happy Hour which turned out to be a great deal. From 4-7pm all the apps were 1/2 off and beers were $3. \\n\\nOver the two days I ordered, split, and/or tried the following: Duck Fat Fries, Skirt Steak, Crab Cakes, Kobe Sliders, and Lobster Fritters. \\n\\nFirst off, none of them disappointed and some of them (crab cakes, and fries) I had the first night and went with again on the second. The DFF's were great. Each fry matched it's sauce perfectly. The skirt steak I will save for last. The crab cakes were the most unique I've ever had. Usually you think of a handcrafted pan sauteed cake. I have no clue how they got this crab cake so perfectly shaped (probably a mold) and so crispy but it was amazing. Not short on crab and had the right amount of of kick, great dish. Next were the Kobe Sliders. For those of you who claim you can't taste the difference between regular beef and Kobe or grass fed beef, there is a McDonald's right across the street from Mandalay. The sliders were seasoned well and the whole burger was delicious. The lobster fritters were, you guessed it, great. So very light and fluffy and a light creme fraiche to accompany it. Last and very much the best was the skirt steak. I actually didn't believe it was skirt steak because of the tenderness. I was lead to believe skirt was a very tough cut and expected it to be very chewy. Quite the contrary, this steak melted in your mouth. That, along with tasting out of this world in terms of seasoning, made this my favorite dish. \\n\\nThe last thing of note was the service. A+. We had the same two bartenders serve us both nights and there were awesome. Two of the most easy going friendly dudes ever. They were right on top of things but weren't over bearing, it was almost like they could read our minds. They featured a homemade blended drink serve with one massive ice cube (apparently from a 20k ice maker) that was a blend of two different types of liquor (i asked but now forget which two) and is mixed with some fruit and other ingredients over a lengthy process and then put out in a colander sitting on a bed of ice. It runs for $14 a glass and the guys had no problem letting us try it. It tasted excellent, almost like an Orange flavor reminding me of Grand Marnier. Overall, it was enjoyable and worth the small priced compared to what it costs to get a mixed drink at every other bar, restaurant, and club in Las Vegas.\",\n",
       " \"Coming here was a bit random.  I was staying at theHotel at Mandalay Bay and a group of us decided to hit the Happy Hour special after a nice run on the craps tables.  I am sure glad we did.\\n\\nI ordered/tried only appetizers this time around.  The list includes Skirt Steak, Oysters, Tiger Prawns, Crab Cakes, Duck Fat Fries, Lobster Fitters and Kobe Sliders.  I could write on and on about how good everything was, but I'll keep this short.\\n\\nThe Skirt Steak was remarkable.  I'd say it was about an 8oz serving and had a chimichurri sauce over it.  Perfectly grilled to my liking.  It was almost as tender as filet.  The steak had a nice char on the outside.  Just perfection all around.\\n\\nMy next favorite the Kobe Sliders.  I'll admit I've never had the pleasure of having a full Kobe steak at any restaurant.  I sort of think it is overhyped, but these were sublime.  They were small, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was a perfect size.  If you go to their Happy Hour, they are 50% off ($10 instead of $20), order 2 orders, they are that good.\\n\\nThe Duck Fat Fries were great.  There were 3 different kinds.  Most reviews have written about them, but I am reiterating how good they were.  The middle ones with the truffle aioli was the best of the bunch.\\n\\nMy next trip to Vegas, hopefully sooner than later, I will be stopping here to try a full meal.  The bartenders commented repeatedly how good their Rib Cap Steak is.  Gotta try it.\",\n",

Everything else was better, so skip this and save room for the good stuff.\\n\\nI got the beet salad with burratta cheese.  I must confess that I love burratta.  I want to take it home and cuddle with it.  When my husband asked for a bite of it, I had a serious internal debate before I decided that sharing was good for my marriage.  The beets were also delicious, but this was all about the cheese for me.  My husband got the wedge salad which was good but not anything out of the ordinary.\\n\\nFor dinner, I got the skirt steak and husband got the short rib.  The short rib was delicious and tender and well sauced.  But I won with the skirt steak.  Meltingly tender, deliciously seasoned.  We also got the scalloped potatoes and the mushrooms which were both fabulous, but the meat was totally the star.\\n\\nWe also had an excellent Spanish Rioja (a new kick we're on) recommended by the sommelier.  It was so good in fact, we reminisced about it the next night as we sat at the bar at Il Mulino while waiting for our table.  So good, that we determined that if the hostess couldn't get her act together and get us seated by the end of our cocktails, we would pay the check and hop in a cab back over to Mandalay.\\n\\nSo our second meal at Stripsteak was just as good.  I pretty much got the same thing again, but with the truffled mac n cheese instead of the potatoes.  Oh my was that good mac n cheese.

       " 'Here\\'s the short version: Worst possible dining experience, no exaggeration. Wrong reservation, terrible service, bad food, and promises broken for a business dinner with our best client.\\n\\nHere\\'s the long version: Came here for a business dinner for our most important client on a recommendation. We made our reservation for their private dining area 2 months in advance to coincide with a trade show. Confirmed our reservation a week or two in advance as well. \\n\\nI checked in with the hostess with about half of our 20+ party there. They said our table would be ready soon and to let them know when our entire party was there. Our entire party arrived about 5 minutes later and I informed them that all were present and she said our table would be ready in a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I check to see if our table was ready. Said it would be soon, just a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I asked about our table and again the answer was soon. Not a good thing to keep a large group and important clients waiting 15 minutes for a private room that was supposed to be reserved. \\n\\nFinally we were told our tables were ready but it was just that, normal tables in their regular dining area. We informed them that their must be a mistake since we specifically reserved their private dining room. We were given some attitude and told that we were mistaken but they would look into it. They quickly learned from their group reservation department that their was some sort of lack or mix-up of communication between them and the hostess. The general manager shows up and began to sweat and apologize to us a thousand times. \\n\\nNothing could be done at the time because they had already given away tables in their private dining area. There was only an approximate estimate of an hour wait to move to that area. We decided to start at the tables we had and move if the private area became available soon. \\n\\nFortunately they said they would be able to move us to the private area after 20 minutes so we headed over. Unfortunately it was not a private room but just a semi-private area partially enclosed by glass walls. And there were still some other diners in the area but we were assured the tables would remain empty once they finished. \\n\\nAfter all of this drama I thought to myself \"hopefully the food is AMAZING and redeems this entire mess.\" However, I was thoroughly disappointed. The blue crab chowder was too salty, the prime rib was mediocre at best (I\\'d rather have Bellagio buffet prime rib), and the desserts were forgetful. \\n\\nIn addition, the service was pretty poor. A number of us had finished our drinks and had empty glasses on our table. They remained empty on our table for at least 20-30 minutes. When I had my water refilled I asked them to take away my other empty glass. It was taken away but all of the other empty glasses were ignored. It was bizarre to me that this simple task was overlooked, especially after the general manager said that he would make sure that we were taken care of and serviced well. He also mentioned that he would give us additional drinks and food and not charge us. After we received the final bill that didn\\'t seem to be the case and it looked like we were charged the full amount. \\n\\nWhat added insult to this all was that the other tables in our semi-private dining area didn\\'t remain empty, they continued to fill them with new diners. We spent about $5000 for the worst possible dining experience on clients who do over $50 million in business with us.',\n",

It was cooked perfectly, nicely crusted, and very tasty.  One of the best I've had.\\n\\nService was very good here too.

       " \"I order a steak about four times a year.  Of those experiences I've enjoyed some exceptional pieces of beef in DC, Philly, Chicago, and NYC.  I have yet to try Minetta Tavern or Carnevino (only drinks), but until I hit those establishments, StripSteak is top of the heap.  \\nMy wife and I each ordered a filet; her's was outstanding, but my Kobe filet was the greatest thing I have ever eaten.  The taste and texture was one of a kind.  We also devoured the creamed spinach and truffle mac and cheese.  And of course, as everyone else has said the fries (gratis) are unbelievable.  We had to wait about 40 minutes, but it was a saturday and we did not have reservations.  thankfully, mandaly bay provides entertainment in the form of craps tables...in addition to its amazing steakhouse.\",\n",
       " 'Stripsteak was good, but definitely not worth the price.  The best part of the meal was the free dipping sauces and french fries.  The atmosphere is also weird because it is very \"open\" and feels like you are eating at a mall.  Try N9NE, Strip House, or Craftsteak for a steak on the strip.',\n",
       " 'Not my favorite Las Vegas steak experience.\\n\\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and waited 15 minutes for our table.  It took our waitress another few minutes to arrive, give us menus, etc.  She seemed disinterested the entire time and rarely checked in on us.  We had to ask for refills on our water, alcohol, etc.\\n\\nThe duck fat fries were amazing, as were their accompanying sauces.  Michael Mina, and his obsession with threes, did well with the three types of fries and sauces.\\n\\nThe steak wasn\\'t amazing.  It pains me to type that.  I expected to bite into that steak and be like \"mmmmmmmmm\" but it was more like \"mmm.\"\\n\\nThe sides I tried were excellent - the truffle mac and cheese was outstanding and the flavors and textures of the creamed spinach made my mouth happy.\\n\\nThe bathrooms were filthy.\\n\\nWith so many amazing steak places in Vegas, I expected more here.  Ah well.',\n",
       " 'Three words: Duck Fat Fries!! Dear lawd. They are heaven! And they were on the happy hour menu. Me and the girls met up with another friend and one of my friends sister to catch up and we picked STRIPSTEAK. We also order the Lobster Grilled Cheese with tomato soup, crabcakes, onion rings, truffled mac and cheese, and scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and caramelized onions. Yes it seems like alot of food but there were 5 of us and we had also had a few cocktails so we were hungry. Believe me, they were all DIVINE!!! I cannot wait to get the chance to go back and have dinner because I know that that will be a treat in itself.',\n",

My boyfriend and I decided to come for our anniversary because we had something set up for us.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Kobe Filet and I ordered the mesquite grilled scallops, both served a la carte.  Nothing special about my scallops, I could have made them at home on a mesquite grill.\\n\\nWe started off with the crab cake and crispy duck thigh appetizer.  I have to say neither of those were anything spectacular.   Actually, as we were eating them, I wished we had ordered something else. \\n\\nFor sides, we ordered the potato puree trio and the spinach souffle.  Both, again just ok.  The spinach souffle was unique which I liked, but the potatoes were just three different kinds: horseradish, lobster, and sour cream and onion.  They also always bring out the trio of fries with the appropriate accompanying sauces and foccaccia bread as appetizers.\\n \\nFor dessert we finished off with their chocolate mousse dessert which I wish I hadn't eaten.\\n\\nAll I'm saying is for the hefty price of $74 for a piece of meat, you would expect everything to be amazing.\\n\\nI'm done with you Stripsteak.

A delightful sweet to get us in the mood...\\n\\nAct 2 - Duck fat fries three ways, with 3 unique dipping sauces, savory sweet spicy every base was covered, these fries were amazing, one of us at the table was a strict pescatarian, the house proceeded to make some cottonseed oil fries specifically for her, with out question or request....\\n\\nAct 3 - Three tunas cooked just the way I like them, not at all...  Sashimi wonderful!  The albacore was simply the best I have ever experienced buttery, fresh, sumptuous, and addictive, the kind of flavor one may pursue the rest of their life...\\n\\nAct 4 - Lobster grilled cheese with tomato soup...  I could not imagine this dish being bad in any way, shape or form, it was truly excellent! \\n\\nAct 5 - Aged veal ribeye, I want to say 60 or 80 days dry aged, I can not be certain, all I know for sure, is it melted in my mouth, it had a deep flavor that only a dry aged steak can achieve, almost Smokey but not...  One of the reasons I like ribeyes is the fat and flavor, this was an exceptionally lean cut ribey but still rich in flavor, this was a top notch cut of beef for sure!\\n\\nAct 5  1/2 - Two sides accompanied the main course, a mélange of puree potato, horseradish, garlic, and lobster...  where is the straw because I could have drank these!  Good stuff!  Second was a hearty portion of thick tender asparagus, baked with lots of pepper and cheese atop, pepper and cheese, two of my favorite things!\\n\\nThroughout this wonderful meal excursion lots of drinks were folded in, for me mainly bourbon, for my friends martinis and wine, I was lucky enough to be dining with fun peeps, so I got to try it all, and everything was there, you know where, just where it should be!\\n\\nI would come back for sure!',\n",
       " \"To be honest nothing really special.  The steak was good full of flavor and pretty good.  The decor of the place is nice.  I ordered the angus ribeye.  The steak was pretty good but very pricey.  The complementarity fries were delicious.  But i felt it didn't really live up to the hefty price tag.\",\n",
       " \"There's a few ways you can look at a restaurant but a review should include all the different perspectives.  \\n\\nQuality of food:  The food here is good.  Not great (4star) not amazing (5 star) just good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly how you ask and they have a pretty decent rub on them.  They are aged and tender as one would expect from any big name steak house.  They gave us a complimentary selection of pommes frittes which were delectable and the truffled mac and cheese was tasty.  However, not a single one of these items mentioned above was better than a 3.5 star rating.  \\n\\nYou could argue that my palate cannot discern the difference between the beefs, but I would like to at least think I can tell the difference between a grain fed cow and one that is massaged by the japanese from kobe.  It also could just be that I've had so many steakhouse steaks that an aged piece of prime beef with a generic rub of salt/pepper just is old hat to me.  \\n\\nService: The service is very good.  As expected from any high end vegas restaurant, they were very attentive and always served you with a smile.  I was amused with the sommelier we saw opening a bottle of wine.  You see, our table was right next to the small station where they open all the bottles of wine.  One table ordered one with a synthetic wine cork.  I know from experience those things are a B*^%@ to open.  It was comforting to know that a man who drinks and dispenses wine for a living also has problems with said cork.\\n\\nAmbiance: Dimly lit, contemporary decor, open kitchen with the meat locker right next to it.  The restaurant is a great place for a date.  \\n\\nPrice: This is where I felt they fall WAY short.  We walked out of there for about 70 to 80 per person.  This included a steak and a side.  The lady got a sirloin steak and i got the ribeye.  If you've been out, you know that the sirloin is the cheaper of the few cuts.  That's why I was surprised that the total bill was pushing over 150.  \\n\\nDont' get me wrong, the strip steak was great.  The ribeye was good.  But in all honesty, I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris or Flemmings where they have something unique.  The broiled steak with butter.  Quality of the meat MIGHT not be as good but it doesn't fall too far away from that at Stripsteak.\\n\\nAfter going to Michael Mina's in Bellagio and coming here. I was excited at first but disappointed after leaving.\",\n",
       " \"It was good.. but not GREAT. \\n\\nThey offered two complimentary appetizers to begin with:\\n1. 3 small selections of pommes frites: paprika, truffle, and duck fat each accompanied with their own dipping sauce.\\nmy favorite has got to be the truffle pommes frites. \\n\\n2. garlic / cheese / rosemary flatbread.\\n\\nAs expected the price was high. But for what I've ordered: a 12oz skirt steak, medium-rare. I expected to have better presentation. Not just a slab of beef on a white plate with a half sliced baby carrot and small roasted onion as the side. I guess i was expecting a little more show for the price i'm paying.\\n\\nMy steak was cooked perfectly and it was juicy (well it BETTER be for the price i'm paying). But it was nothing special. I don't know - it's hard to explain.. I mean i enjoyed my steak, but it was not memorable.\\n\\nI ordered a side of truffle mac & cheese. I enjoyed it a lot. It definitely has the truffle and cheese - i dont mind eating the whole thing by myself.\\n\\nMy friend ordered a seared ahi tuna steak.. which was not good at all. the tuna did not have any fresh tuna taste (not saying it was not fresh.. but a good tuna has a fresh taste).. this one here was kinda bland. like a fake watered down tuna taste (dunno if that even make sense, but that's how i'd describe it). I know i know, why would u even order fish at a steakhouse, right? but hey, i still think that if you're going to charge people that price, at least make it LOOK good, even if it doesn't taste good. \\n\\nThe presentation for each dish was kinda boring.\",\n",
       " 'I liked that they gave us complimentary bread and fries.  I liked that they kept filing my glass with water.  And I like that my food came out quickly.  I had my ahi tuna, which came out as a filet. Nice and plump.  However, everything here was just decent for me.  Nothing spectacular.',\n",

And the employees at Stripsteak were more than happy to oblige.  (Wish I could indulge exactly what happened....but what happens in Vegas...well you know the rest) Again, meals were paid for, but this time she and I lived it up by ordering the Kobe Rib Eye, Macaroni and Cheese (OMG!) and a bunch of oysters!

       " \"I did not eat food here. My friends and I mainly stopped to grab a drink at the bar after a Cirque show. I had the cucumber martini and it was amazing! I didn't tast any alcohol- which I prefer. It tasted just like a cucumber. I can imagine how refreshing this drink must be on a hot summer day. The bar staff was very friendly as well.\",\n",
       " \"After dining at Il Mulino, L'Atelier, Julian Serrano, our last dinner was at Stripsteak for the 3 course Prix Fixe dinner at $55/person and we ended on a positive note. First course: Blue crab chowder--chunks of crab but soup was a bit thin OR bibb salad with blue cheese dressing--good choice if you're going to overdose on the meat and carbs to come. Second course: slow poached prime rib--okay, but I still like PR the traditional way OR pay extra $10 for the ribeye steak--juicy, flavorful and worth the supplement. Third course: rootbeer float with choc chip cookies still warm from the oven--yes, this is the perfect ending to a rich meal. I loved the generous scoop of ice cream with sarsaparilla. In addition, we got pommes frites with different dippings that were excellent, and the sides to the entrees included truffle mac and cheese, creamed spinach, sliced brussels sprouts with bacon bits. You go away feeling really full!\\n   The service was attentive and understanding, especially since I accidentally knocked over my wine, the glass broke and wine spilled all over our entrees. They cleaned up efficiently and brought us new entrees in about 5 minutes. I would return for another great steak dinner, especially since this prix fixe is available all evening and is a great value.\",\n",
       " 'I ordered the Filet Mignon. Steak was a little too salty and cooked just passed medium rare. \\n\\nI also had asparagus and the scalloped potatoes, they were both drizzled with a white sauce which was OK tasting. The complimentary fries cooked in duck fat were a nice snack before my meal but will pass on a return visit.',\n",
       " \"So I decided to give in and try a fancy schmancy place on the strip over the weekend. Usually I try to avoid restaurants on the Strip because they're overcrowded, overpriced and in general the wait is to long. Luckily I had to join my friend as she was meeting a group at StripSteak for happy hour. \\n\\nWalking up to the restaurant, we were generously greeted by the Assistant GM Miss Ashley and the rest of her hosting staff. Our group was easily accommodated since the happy hour was pretty dead. According to Miss Ashley, that was rare on a Saturday night. To me, it was luck because I would then be able to assess a fair review on this place. \\n\\nThe bar area is fairly small, I would say that the big comfy purple seats do tend to take up a lot of space within that bar area that it really wasn't an ideal place for a group of 8 to be sitting. Plus we made it a little difficult for the wait staff to maneuver around. Their happy hour drink & food menu is reasonably priced. I would highly recommend their specialty, the cucumber martinish drink, it was quite refreshing and a great summertime drink. And this means a lot since I'm more of a beer drinker. The raspberry lemonade & mojitos were just ok, maybe a little to weak, but again that's just my opinion. \\n\\nMy friend and I decided to try dinner so we asked the staff for a table in the dining area and were quickly accommodated. Right away we were greeted with complimentary duck fries, which we also had ordered during happy hour. These fries are cooked in duck fat so don't worry it's not any crazy duck part, which I would have hoped for. There are three different rings of fries - paprika smoked, truffle and garlic Parmesan. The sauces were just ok, it was the general concept of ketchup, BBQ sauce and truffle aioli but of course more upscale. I preferred to munch on the suckers without any of the sauces. \\n\\nOur waiter, Steve, was awesome. He highly recommended the Rib Cap & Filet Mignon, along with a side of truffle mac & cheese and honestly it was phenomenal. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and just melted in your mouth. The Rib cap, which is the end part of the rib eye, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The truffle mac & cheese was definitely the best truffle mac & cheese I have experienced in a while. Most tend to be dry but this one was moist and also had pieces of broccoli that it never lost it's flavor. We also had a side of asparagus with a horseradish blanc sauce. I couldn't complain about anything. At first I laughed at the portion size but then as we kept eating I was actually pretty full. Also it might have been the alcohol we had prior to dinner! And me not knowing if you are allowed to take a doggy bag from such places, found the inner strength to finish our food, it truly was like a scene out of Man vs Food. \\n\\nBut wait, we weren't done! WTH? Steve charmed us into trying dessert, I figured what the heck, let's go all out! We ordered the beignets with their chocolate butterscotch pudding. Whew! I think I was getting drunk off the pudding, I might have been able to light a fire. However, the beignets were soft and moist and perfectly fried. \\n\\nOverall the ambiance of StripSteak is great, perfect for a date or just to people watch from the bar. It did tend to get busier as the night progressed. Yes it's quite pricey but honesty I have to say it was the best experience I have had in a while at a Strip restaurant. Michael Mina did a phenomenal job with this place and all the employees were great. To see the AGM serving drinks, chatting with customers, waiting on guests, cleaning tables and bringing out checks says a lot about the employee morale. She helped making the dining experience that much better.\\n\\nThe only thing I would say is that yes the meat platters need to have a little more presentation. Maybe had a sprig of rosemary or something, just to give it a little more color and pizzazz.. \\n\\nFood for thought - 1) make sure you have reservations 2) make sure you give yourself enough time to have dinner as our evening lasted over 4 hours 3) if you can't stomach rich food, be aware that some of their steaks are cooked with butter. Yay for TUMS! 4) All sides are al a carte so expect to pay over $100 for a 2 person dinner.\",\n",

       " \"Stripsteak is a Michael Mina restaurant in Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. \\n\\nStart with duck and sashimi .. The duck appetizer was fantastic. 5. Sashimi was awesome too, and the nice touch is that there was real wasabe and not the pasty generic kind. Tasty and sentious : 4.75 out of 5.\\n\\nGinger beer nice selection, as suggested by the server when I ordered ginger ale. 4.5\\n\\nFlight of fries was cute and noshy.. very bistro chic. 4.5\\n\\nMarrow : delicious and rich. Served with perfectly sized toastettes... 5\\n\\nDry aged rib eye 3.5 out of 5. Hate to say it, but a bit too much marbling and gristle. I would rate the meat quality as a choice cut, but not prime or Angus. Also, I would have expected the steak to be served decently hot, but it came to the table cooler than being let to rest after cooking.  The smokey (Alder) was a bit more overwhelming than expected and I felt it impeded the taste you should be getting from proper aged beef.  I know I'm being a bit critical here, but I have had awesome creations from Mina and know he can purvey far better. Maybe it was an off night.. \\n\\nNoise: dang loud. But it's Vegas. \\n\\nService: Decent but seemingly with slow dips. I was disappointed with a few things though. The server was very nice for the most part but did two things a server should not do:\\n\\nFirst:  Please never clear one diner's plate before the other diner has finished the course. IT isn't proper etiquette. \\n\\nSecond:  when offered the taste of the ginger beer, it truly was a good selection. I hadn't even drank the ginger ale yet. The server was a tad patronizing in stating she would get me the ginger beer as well, and did not remove the ginger ale from the tab. Partially my fault for not asking for a taste, but the proper manner should have been to be offered a taste first before bringing me both. I know it wasn't malicious.. and it was during the Consumer Electronics Show, so she may have had her fill with attendees that didn't know proper dining etiquette.  2/5\\n\\nI say overall itWould I go back? Yes.. Kinda like learning a new country and their customs, I know what to focus on more. I'll be back in Vegas in a few weeks and will give them a try again because I do see the potential.\",\n",
       " 'DUCK FAT FRIES.\\n\\nSeriously.',\n",
       " 'Steak here is quite bomb-good! It\\'s a Michael Mina restaurant, so his signature style is interpreting an ingredient in 3 different preparations and flavors. So I was excited when this came out first while we decide on drinks.\\n\\nTRIO OF DUCK FAT FRIES (comp amuse) - 5 stars\\n1. Smoked paprika and mustard fries w/a smoked paprika and mustard crème fraîche dip \\n2. Truffle fries with a truffle aïoli dip\\n3. Rosemary and onion fries with an onion ketchup dip\\n\\nI love french fries and these were cooked right. Fresh potatoes were cut and fried to perfection. The exterior was crispy and the inside was soft with a richer taste coz of the duck fat.\\n\\nOur table didn\\'t get the 2nd complimentary dish, the olive oil focaccia. I should have asked, but I wanted to save room for steak.\\n\\nSTRIP-PEAR ($13) - 4 stars\\nI chose the Strip-Pear martini. It\\'s made with Grey Goose La Poire (Anjou pear flavored vodka), lychee puree (instead of the usual pear puree) and fresh lime juice. Pear was the main flavor with a hint of lychee. It was sweet and medium strong... nice.\\n\\nOther drinks we got were: Guinness ($8), Stella Artois ($8), New Castle ($7) and Lustau Solera ($13).\\n\\n18oz DRY-AGED BONE-IN RIB EYE ($51) - 4 stars\\n10oz FILET MIGNON ($54) - 4.5 stars\\nAll of our steaks came out medium/high warm. Note, after grilling steaks need to rest for the juices redistribute. Both steaks were super tasty and tender with a smokey and peppery finish. All 4 (1 rib eye and 3 filets) steaks were cooked perfectly as requested. \\n\\nThe plate presentation is simple: steak, a whole roasted shallot and yellow pepper and garnished with a small sprig of thyme. No fluffy presentation for the main dish. There\\'s room on the plate to place your sides.  It\\'s a steakhouse after all.\\n\\nI asked out server how the steaks are cooked and she said, \"They\\'re poached then grilled and basted with a wine butter.\" I did some research to get the details of how they cook their steaks.\\n\\nStep 1: Steaks are placed in slow-poaching chambers, which enhances flavor and tenderness. The meat heats for several hours at a low temperature. \\n\\nStep 2: Steaks are then grilled on a cast iron grill above mesquite wood. The wood gives every cut of steak a nice subtle smokiness.\\n\\nPOTATO PUREE TRIO ($14)  - 4 stars\\nAnother trio dish we ordered. The 3 flavors were: horseradish, lobster and sour cream. The puree was seasoned nicely. All of the purees were smooth, rich and creamy. \\n\\nBACON-CREAMED SPINACH ($10) - 4 stars\\nThe crowd fav was the creamed spinach. It was made with spinach, heavy cream, shallot, garlic, butter, nutmeg, S&P and topped with bacon crumbs.\\n\\nPASSION FRUIT PANNA COTTA ($12) - 4 stars\\nPassion fruit pieces, red grape fruit, thin slices of avocado, and coconut sorbet sit atop the panna cotta. The panna cotta itselft was refreshing, light and subtle sweet. The avocado gave the dessert extra creaminess and weight. While the grapefruit and coconut sorbet gave it a tart and sweet pairing.\\n\\nMILK CHOCOLATE CUSTARD ($12) - 3.5 stars\\nSmall red velvet cake pieces, powder sugar, toasted pecans, cocoa nib ice cream lay on top of the chocolate custard. This dessert was smooth and rich like a very thick pudding. The topping provided a nice contrast.\\n\\nI was so full by the end of dinner. Anyhow, the steak dinner was a nice way to close out our weekend of Vegas fun. Cost for a party of 4 with tax was $335 (alcohol $49, steaks $213, sides $24 and dessert $24). \\n\\nReduce costs by 1) get alkie during happy hour 4-7pm at the bar, 2) non-big eaters share a steak or 3) order the prix fixe menu 3-courses for $55. Prix fixe only offers chicken or prime rib. \\n\\nOverall, my experience was good. It\\'s better than all of the chain steakhouses: Fleming\\'s, Ruth\\'s Chris, Morton\\'s, BLT Steak, etc. Next steakhouses, I\\'d like to try is Mastro\\'s and CUT.',\n",

They used to have grits with shaved truffle as a side and those were amazing--and I don't like grits--so sad when I went 2 months ago and they were no longer on the menu.  Brussels sprouts side--I don't like Brussels sprouts and these were super tasty (I think they normally have bacon in them but we had asked for them without).  The appetizer special last time I went was braised veal cheek--wow, so tender and flavorful--I loved this!  I think I'm considered strange and love skirt steak.  This cut just has so much flavor.  It doesn't have that ohh ahh people say about ribeye...but I still love skirt steak.  Steaks here have a smokey flavor which I love.

First time I've ever had duck fat french fries and they were amazing.  The dipping sauces were all great.  We also tried the bacon-wrapped lobster appetizer and the crab cake appetizer.  Both were excellent with the crab cake being the better of the two.  For entree's I had the american kobe filet served medium rare and the person I was with had the american kobe rib cap.  Both steaks were prepared perfectly.  The rib cap was the more flavorful of the two steaks but was a bit tougher than the filet.  I thought the filet was definitely better than the rib cap.  For side dishes, we had the truffled mac & cheese and the spinach souffle.  Both were also excellent.  Can't wait to go back!\",\n",

As an appetizer, definitely go with the Duck Fat Fries!!! I also had the West Coast Oysters and the East Coast Oysters appetizer plates, but I do prefer the East Coast more! You won't go wrong with the American Kobe beef burger or the American Kobe beef steak...they are a must have!!!  I can't wait till they are able to import the Japanese Kobe beef...that is what I am waiting for and definitely worth the wait, so I hear!!!  As side dishes, the spinach, asparagus, macaroni, mushrooms, scalloped potatoes are all good.  Like I said earlier, this is by far one of my fav places to dine out in Vegas!!!

       " \"Steak? Yes please!\\n\\nI can't get enough of good ol red meat. I have tried the lamb, ribeye and NY strip here. All to die for and all cooked to perfection. What sold me more than any of that were the sides. They were the best part of my meal. That's hard to do when there's a nice juicy steak sitting in front of me, but the brussel sprouts, mushrooms and french fries stole the show. \\n\\nAll delicious, all the time. The vibe here is pretty great too. Perfect for out of town guests, a date with your honey or a family night out. This place is versatile and has a great atmostphere. The servers are all really friendly and helpful too. Come for happy hour, it's pretty groovy.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a trip to the strip.\",\n",
       " \"Amazing steak house.  I ate here last week and had the ribeye which was to DIE for!!!!!  The chef also treats you to a sampling of the different french fries which is also amazing.  My other favorite steak house is Michael Jordan's @ mohegan sun in CT.  This place is AMAZING, if you love steak this place is for you.\",\n",
       " \"Wow this was a great meal. The food overall tonight was simply amazing. Some dishes were a miss but most of them were amazing. The way the restaurant looked was beautiful. A big seating area with exceptional service. The complimentary duck fat fries set off a great tone. Three different duck fat fries flavors with three different sauces. I was very impressed with this complimentary dish that I was going to ask for more. For my main course I ordered the wagyu kobe filet. I ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked. It tasted so soft and flavorful. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The sides I tried were the potato puree, asparagus, spinach souflee, truffle mac and cheese, and crab cakes. My favorites were the potato puree which was a very soft whipped mashed potato in three different flavors. Amazing presentation and amazing tastes. My other favorite was the truffle mac and cheese. I just couldn't get enough of that thing. This is how all my meals should be. \\n\\nRecommendation: Wagyu filet steak, truffle mac and cheese, and potatoe puree\",\n",

My fiance had the fillet mignon. Also very good but doesn't hold a candle to the kobe cap. \\nFor sides we went with the truffled mac n cheese which was basically a party in your mouth with every bite.

The spinach was good and so was the scalloped potatoes. I The mac n cheese was good but I'm not a fan of truffles.\\n\\nThey also give you complimentary fries while waiting for your food.

As far as customer service goes, this is the best I've experienced. Ashley really made me feel welcomed.\\n\\nI ordered the maine crab chowder and the lobster fritter:\\n\\nCrab Chowder: this soup was fantastic. The chunks of crab in the soup were huge and incredibly fresh. The soup itself was silky smooth, flavorful and reminded you of the sea.\\n\\nLobster fritter: these fritters were also really good. they look like miniature corn dogs but with bacon wrapped lobster in a light batter. Per Ashley's instructions, you are to squeeze the lime onto the fritter, then dabble a good amount of creme fresh, and then wrap it in butter lettuce. The results were short of genius. The butter lettuce gave it a good balance to offset any oiliness the batter may have. \\n\\np.s. Order the raspberry martini. It was strong as shit. next time, i'm definitely going to order the filet tartare and the kobe shabu shabu.\\n\\nOld Review: I ordered the now legendary American Kobe Rib Cap with Truffled Mac N Cheese. The server also brought out a complimentary trio of fries: truffle, herb, and cajun. The truffle aioli was out of this world. Unfortunately, I can't be this complimentary with the rest of the meal.\\n\\nLet's start with the Truffled Mac N Cheese. This was a great dish. It wasn't too creamy and it wasn't too runny. The consistency was perfect. The cheese wasn't overpowering, so the truffle was able to shine through.\\n\\nMy problem with STRIPSTEAK was their overrated Kobe Rib Cap. What I received was way too salty. With a steak valued at nearly $70, I expected perfection. I do give them props for the way they cooked the steak though. The crust was crisp, and the center was tender. It would be a great piece of meat if they didn't dump a ton of salt on it.\",\n",

The fries were good--but cold. My husband ordered the rib-eye...this was room temperature and so was the mac and cheese. I got the salmon which was good and so were the scalloped potatoes. My brothers skirt steak was unbelievably salty. It seems like the whole restaurant got free dessert--us included because of the terrible service.

I ordered the 10 oz filet with asparagus ... OMG I thought I had died and gone to filet heaven!!  It was stellar!!  Tender and delicious ... it's everything I could ask for in a filet.  And the fries that are served complimentary ... let's put it this way ... I don't eat fried food, but I found myself devouring these.  They brought 3 different seasoned fries and I couldn't really tell you what the seasoning was on each, but who cares!!  YUM!\\n\\nWe had no issues with service.  Everything was fantastic!\",\n",

The menu was extensive in its selection of steak. There were a great variety of types of meat from T-bone to Kobe cap. We ordered the lobster salad w/ grapefruit vinaigrette. It had a slight tanginess to the sweet fresh lobster. I ordered the diver scallops w/ cajun spice--which actually didn't wow me at all. It basically was grilled scallops w/ lemon for $40.  My boyfriend ordred 18 oz. bone-in rib eye which was a hearty portion! I actually liked his steak a lot more than my own scallops. We also ordered the Mac & Cheese in truffle oil and mushrooms. Both of which were amazingly good and I would recommend that you order it w/ your meat! The truffle oil gave the Mac & Cheese a distinct taste that separated it from your typical American/Cheddar mac & cheese. \\n\\nHonestly, I felt like the food was good here, but it's definitely too expensive for the portion that they give you. I have been to other steak houses that offered the same type of food for a little bit cheaper. Definitely try it but keep in mind that it might break your bank.\",\n",

Well it was not worth the wait.  I thought my steak was dipped in salt,  I could not taste the steak,  the salt was over powering.  I could taste it throughout and it left a very bad taste on my palate.  My wife's scallops were over salted too.  Then i start hearing from the table next to me,  told you we should of went to jack in the box. They offered free desserts to a lot of tables, including ours which was nice,  i did not have our meal replaced cause i thought it may take too long and was so hungry so I did a little patting with my napkin to reduce the salt and finished with a large glass of water., but i do not think I am coming back.

So when the gentleman behind the bar described them as \"phenomenal\", I was all in.  Phenomenal was kind of a reach but with the pancetta and fennel mixed in, they were tasty.\\n\\nI like this place.  I stopped in for dinner at the bar and it was definitely the most entertaining seat in the house.  I never knew that people slammed martinis like teenagers on spring break but apparently they do.  Seems like it would be much more efficient to just buy a handle of Skol.  But I digress.\\n\\nI started out with a Rockin\\' Rye, which is a pre mixed house concoction of rye, rum, \"aromatics & herbs\" served with one giant ice cube.  It\\'s kind of fun that they have it up lit in a glass decanter on the bar.  It\\'s a pretty good cocktail.\\n\\nFor dinner I ordered the loup de mer, which is prepared mesquite grilled with a little olive oil...and the peas.

Nothing at Mandalay was impressive and this was the worst. Even after they apologized for the time, the steak that was sent out cold was just reheated and therefore not the medium rare we requested.

The decor is swanky and clean, sitting area is not that big, with a small bar and lounge area. After we sat down, the waiter brought out the complimentary duck fat fries in a trio of flavors - herb, truffle, and old bay, each with a different sauce. Very asty. The drinks are a bit pricey like the $14 Cucumber Martini (alcohol is light, but the cucumber is very cool and refreshing). We started with a dozen oysters (very small, but the taste is very strong, very fresh). Our table all ordered the 18oz dry aged bone-in rib eye, medium rare (very well seasoned, juicy, melts in your mouth steak - couldn't get enough of it and at the end I kind of wished I had ordered the 30oz porterhouse instead). We got the roasted marrow bones on the side (bones were a bit smaller than what I had elsewhere but still good). For sides, we got the truffled mac and chees (this is a MUST - the truffle flavor is strong) and also the potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream/onion, horseradish) which went well with the steak but it was just okay.

I heart him. \\n\\nFood - A+! My husband ordered the skirt steak with a add-on of crab legs. Originally he ordered the lobster tail, but our waiter recommended the crab legs, since they are a bit bigger, more bang for your buck! (I said that not the waiter lol) He LOVED it. He was smiling the whole time. He was happy that the waiter recommended the crab legs because he loved them too! \\n\\nI ordered the Kobe burger. I ordered it well done. I always order my meat well done. My burger came out kinda charred. Not sure if it was the \"well-done\" factoring in. I actually had to cut the top and bottom off the patty so I could taste the flavor of the meat. It wasn\\'t a big deal. Like I said I am not a big meat person. I didn\\'t mind if my meat patty was 1/2 the size in the end. If I ate here again, I would def not order the burger. I was eying the roasted chicken.. maybe I\\'ll get that next time. \\n\\nThe sides! The mac and cheese is a must order! We also ordered the scalloped potatoes which wasn\\'t AMAZINGLY good. For 2 people I would say one side order would\\'ve been adequate. We barely touched the potatoes.

       " 'The following review is based on one dinner experience:\\n\\nFOOD: 5 stars\\n\\nAppetizer - Trio of Duck Fat Fries\\nEach meal is preceded by a complimentary order of the trio of duck fat fries.  The trio includes:\\n\\n1.  Paprika and mustard fries accompanied with a mustard crème dip\\n2. Truffle fries accompanied with truffle aïoli dip\\n3. Rosemary and onion fries accompanied with onion ketchup dip\\n\\nMy taste buds couldn\\'t really tell the difference between duck fat fries and fries cooked in regular vegetable oil.  The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The fries aren\\'t particularly better than any other restaurant quality fries, but they make for a nice \"complimentary\" appetizer while waiting for your meal.  \\n\\nThere\\'s more than enough pics of the fries on Yelp so you can get a glimpse of the appearance and presentation.  \\n\\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\nThe steak entrees have a very simple presentation with just the meat, a grilled scallion, and grilled yellow pepper on a large plate.  Both steaks smelled like they were hot off the grill.  \\n\\n1. 16oz Dry-Aged Bone In Rib Eye (medium well)  $51\\n\\nThis particular steak is more fatty than the Filet Mignon and Kansas City Strip.  The fattiness contributes to the melts in your mouth factor.  Not a piece of this meat had that dry chewy quality that separates good steaks from bad steaks.  I\\'m not sure how the meat was seasoned, but there was a subtle spiciness that enhanced the flavor of the meat.  \\n\\n2. 10oz Filet Mignon (medium well)  $54\\n\\nThis steak was my favorite.  Once again the meat was tender and flavorful.  Although it wasn\\'t fatty like the rib eye, it was still amazingly moist and melted in my mouth.  \\n\\n\\nSERVICE: 5 stars\\n\\nOur server was very quick, attentive, and friendly.  She was all about enhancing \"the experience\".   She was also accommodating to all our special requests and knowledgeable.  What I thought was cool about this place was that when I asked for another side of the mustard for the fries, they didn\\'t just bring me a small cup, but decent sized bowl.  \\n\\nI thought it was kind of annoying though that as we left, every person who worked there said goodnight to us.  I understand the concept of service, but having all your employees say good night to customers who they had no interaction with comes off as a bit fake.  \\n\\nI noticed some reviewers complaining that service was slow.  They must have gone during a busy weekend because we were quickly seated and had no issues with slow service.  \\n\\n\\nMisc. Info:\\n\\nStripsteak is good for a date, dinner with friends, or a celebration dinner.  It\\'s not super formal, but I wouldn\\'t come here wearing shorts and a wife beater.  \\n\\nIf you come with a date, you\\'re likely to be seated near the bar where they have more seating for 2.  Most of the restaurant seems organized based on seating groups.  \\n\\nGet the deal on www.restaurant.com',\n",

I'm not sure I would order them again, only because the rest of the food was amazing!\\n\\nOur steaks were cooked to perfection! Cut with a fork they were so tender! While the two sides were way too much for two of us, they were a great accompaniment. We savored every bite!\\n\\nWe also ordered a $90 bottle of wine. That is way more than we usually pay for wine (in fact, this whole meal was more than our biweekly food budget!), but it was awesome. Unfortunately we both drank too much of it to remember the name! Bottom line- just let them pick the wine. They won't disappoint!\\n\\nWhile it was not needed, we indulged in the marscapone cheesecake. WOW.

With that said I am very happy they talked me out of it as this experience was completely different from our previous visit.\\n\\n1st off ambiance wise you can\\'t beat the place. Very trendy yet elegant. Service staff spot on. Complimentary Appetizer - Trio of Duck Fat Fries\\nEach meal is preceded by a complimentary order of the trio of duck fat fries.  The trio includes:\\n\\n1.  Paprika and mustard fries accompanied with a mustard crème dip\\n2. Truffle fries accompanied with truffle aïoli dip\\n3. Rosemary and onion fries accompanied with onion ketchup dip\\nThe Truffle fries great and the best of the 3 but nice touch instead of the regular bread & Butter. \\n\\nOnward we go. Glasses of wine ordered as nobody wanted the same thing, and a bit pricey per glass but nice selection. \\n\\n3 of us tonight so it was 3 Steaks and two sides I\\'ll keep it simple.\\n\\nA: KC Bone in NY Strip Charred medium. (Cooked to perfection)Tasty, moist, juicy, a 10 on the steak scale.\\n\\nB: Bone in Rib Eye Charred Medium (See above Perfection)\\n\\nC.  Slow poached prime rib perhaps the weakest of the 3 but still very good, not as thick as I would have preferred if I was ordering it.\\n\\nSides Truffle Mac & Cheese & Bacon Cream Spinach\\n\\nSpinach \"GREAT\" simply stated\\n\\nTruffle Mac & Cheese Great except for one thing, no mention of broccoli in this dish yet it had pieces of it and I hate broccoli. Taste was exceptional aside from the unwanted greens.\\n\\nNo Deserts...  A quick meal with excellent service, super food in great ambiance..  Won a few bucks at the dice table afterwards to pay for this thing....',\n",
       " 'Greetings from your resident picky eater.  I know you are probably surprised to see me write a review of a steak house considering I don\\'t like steak and normally these hoyty toyty establishments do not cater to those with a palate of a five year old.  \\n\\nLet me set the scene.  My husband advised me he is taking me out to dinner yet would not tell me where.  This alarms me because after knowing each other for nine years he still tries to surprise me by taking me to placing such as Prime Rib Loft and PF Changs.  Guess where we are going??  StripSteak.  Apparently, you can get a coupon on restaurants.com and so he wanted to give it a try.  Panic sets in as I am worried what will I eat.. again I don\\'t like steak and I especially don\\'t like a steak I would have to pay $50 dollars for.  My husband Michael assures me he has looked over the menu and told me they have chicken dishes and even mac & cheese.\\n\\nUpon arrival we are seating and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable.  Michael had advised them we are there to celebrate my birthday.  It was two weeks ago but if I know my husband he was hoping to get a free dessert out of it.  There was a very nice happy birthday card placed at our table which I thought was a very nice touch.  \\n\\nLooking at the menu.. oh dear oh dear there is ONE chicken dish.. not chicken dishes (plural) as Michael had indicated.  Organic chicken it is.  Michael opts for the kobe beef burger.  I order a corona and Michael orders a Pepsi.  (Stay tuned as the Pepsi will come into play later on in my story)\\n\\nWe are then provided a sample of the duck fat fries three ways with three different dipping sauces.  They consisted of old bay seasoned fries, rosemary garlic type fries, and plain duck fat fries.  The sauces were some mustard crème nonsense (which kind of tasted like ranch), ketchup, and truffle aioli.  May I just say that the truffle aioli was amazing.  Who would have thought it would win over ketchup in my mind.  While enjoying our delicious fries, Michael is especially entertained in watching the people constantly stop to take pictures at their famous boob sculpture in the walkway to the Conference Center. \\n\\nMeal arrives.  My plate is very fancy with some onion jus drizzled around the plate and a lovely piece of chicken on top of some truffle mac & cheese.  Michael wastes no time diving into his kobe burger for which I think he foodgasmed after the first bite.  Now my chicken report.  It was delicious!!! So moist and flavorful - it better be for $30 bucks.  It had nice grill char marks on it which added to the flavor profile.  The mac and cheese was good as well but alert.. there were two broccoli thingies mixed in it and a couple of baby carrots!  This was not an invited guest to the party and I did not appreciate them hiding out under the chicken to surprise me.  Luckily I was able to remove most of the little tree top specs and continue with my meal without incident.  I decided to share my chicken with Michael.... \"This is not a normal chicken!\" he says as I think he was shared a spiritual moment with my chicken.  He then tried one of my baby carrots and asked for another.  Against my better judgment I tried the smallest of bites possible of the carrot and holy cow it didn\\'t even taste like a carrot.  It almost melted in my mouth - probably all the butter it was drenched in.  I that that was the first time I eat a carrot since I was forced to stay at the table until I finished them when I was 8.  \\n\\nThe meal has now ended.  Our waiter asks if we would like to order dessert.  Although the $700 glass of cognac was tempting we decided to pass.  Michael was looking around wondering where is my happy birthday scoop of ice cream?  We then get the bill and I think Michael about had a heart attack.  Remember the Pepsi I mentioned earlier?  Well apparently they are $4 - each.   Michael had four of them because they are served in those skinny bar glasses that you could finish in one sip!  So he paid $16 bucks for Pepsi (not even Coke!) That was $9 less then my Corona.  I found it quite funny.  We did however receive two small bags of some sort of chocolate drizzled caramel popcorn which I didn\\'t get the connection but thought was nice.  \\n\\nTo summarize, although places like this are not my cup of tea I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Be forewarned if ordering a soda that it is by the glass.  If I could offer any suggestions it would be to perhaps replace the broccoli bits with bacon in the truffle mac & cheese.  Even with our $50 coupon we ended up paying about $50 dollars out of pocket (thanks to Michael\\'s soda binge) but this is a nice place for special occasion.',\n",
       " \"Ate here last month with my boyfriend  while on our mini getaway trip. It was my first time,  his second time, so of course he was hype'n it up- mainly the duck fat fries and the Kobe beef tartare. Let me inform you all that my BF is kinda closed minded when it comes to food so him eating raw-mooing-cow meat was effin crazy for me to hear! \\n\\nAnyway, this place is good. Michael Mina, thank you. Complimentary duck fat fries were bomb.com they were a bit salty, but so crunchy and cooked perfectly. They came in three different flavors with three different dipping sauces they were all yummy! \\n\\nKobe beef tartare: surprisingly good. The server brings the tartare and spices on a plate, explains each spice, asks if we are ok with each and then mixes it all in front of us. He then puts it in the bowl over ice, and it is served with grilled pita bread. It was Awesome. I was skeptical\\nAbout eating raw meat, but if it's Kobe, I guess it's fine?\\n\\nOur main course was our steAks. I had the skirt steak and my BF had the 18oz ribeye. Cant say anything bad about em. Our sides were the creamed spinach and the scalloped potatoes. \\n\\nDESSERT: MADAGASCAR VANILLA BEAN CREME BRULEE WITH BEIGNETS OH-EM-GEE! MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE SERVING WAS TOO SMALL! I WILL GLADLY FLY MY ASS BACK TO VEGAS JUST FOR THIS.\",\n",
       " \"By far the best steakhouse I've ever been to. Went there as one of the events for my friend's bachelor party/foodie weekend at Vegas. The decor is very modern, with a small dining area (has booths as well as tables), a bar and a small lounging area. It was 5 people in our party, and as soon as we sat down, they brought out complimentary duck fat fries cooked 3 different ways: truffle, old bay and regular, and it came with dipping sauces. Next 4 out of the 5 of us ordered the 18oz dry aged bone-in rib eye, medium rare (cuts like butter, very juicy). As a appetizer , we ordered the roasted bone marrow, which was really good, but smaller than the other places I've ordered the bone marrow at. For sides, we ordered the potato puree trio that comes in 3 different flavors: sour cream/onion, lobster, and horseradish. Another side we ordered IS A MUST, which is the truffle mac and cheese! It was so good.\\n\\nOverall, the service was excellent, the food was great, but the place is pricey, but at the same time, you get what you paid for, so it was all worth it. I would highly recommend this place to other people, and I don't know if i can ever have steak from other places cause this place just set the bar too high haha.\",\n",
       " 'Short review: Eat here.\\n\\nMedium review: You have many choices in Vegas....make Stripsteak one of them! \\n\\nLonger review: Monday night - ate here. Wednesday night - dreamt about the Truffle Mac \\'n Cheese, Ducky Fat Fried French Fries, Wagyu Kobe rib \"eye\". Glorious!\\n\\nCompletely agree with all of the other reviewers re the service and worth the splurge.\\n\\np.s.\\nI start my Vegas detox tomorrow!',\n",
       " \"Very disappointing.\\n\\nFirst the ambiance. It's extremely loud, almost to the point of not being able to hear the person across from you.  Tables with no cloths and paper place mats.  That seems to be the thing with a lot of Vegas steak houses now, charge premium prices but present a coffee shop atmosphere.  \\n\\nNone of that is as important as the food, of course.  We both love steak tartare, so we ordered that for the appetizer.  It was loaded with black pepper. So much so, that frankly, that's all I could taste.  \\n\\nThen a 50 minute wait for our main course.  At about 40 minutes I was getting irate and was just about to go complain when the general manager did stop by our table to apologize and say our food would be here shortly.  \\n\\nWhen the main course did finally arrive, the wagyu filets we both ordered were both cooked perfectly, and were melt-in-your-mouth delicous.  I ordered a lobster tail with mine, and it was small and chewy.  The sides  we ordered were average, not bad, but nothing great.\\n\\nThe service was friendly, but very poor. Our server seemed a bit...how should I say this...out of it.  Whenever she came to our table she had a huge smile on her face, as if she just a heard a hilarious joke.  But if I asked her a question about something, she didn't even respond, as if she didn't hear me.  I know it was loud in there, but you would think she could see me looking at her with my lips moving.  Because of the 50 minute wait (during which we never saw her, by the way), we had finished our bottle of wine before the steaks even arrived, so I ordered another glass with our main course.   She finally brought it with desert. Along with our coffee. SIgh.  Speaking of desert, it was fine, once again nothing special, but pretty good.\\n\\n$460.00 with tip for the two of us. That included a $120 bottle of wine.  It was just not worth it. Craftsteak is much better, and Delmonico is much much better.  \\n\\nI'm baffled at all the rave reviews.  Maybe we just hit it on a bad night?  Or maybe a lot of people have just never been to a really good steak house?  I mean, yeah we did get the free french fries too, and they were tasty, but really, they're just french fries people\",\n",
       " 'Terrible service. Bathroom experience cause me to gag and vomit slightly (bathrooms are not bussed per use and this is supposed to be classy, ventilation not good enough). I think bathrooms are the easiest way to rate an establishment. \\n\\nServers are not fair with time. I was made to wait several minutes to order my drinks while a fat, tattooed lazy and unprofessional server yucked it up with an intoxicated patron next to my table. I also saw servers with disgusting hepatitis looking tattoos and piercings and these are revolting to fine diners. \\n\\nSteaks are excellent (Kobe rib cap), bone marrow was good, beef tartare was very good. Beet salad good. Joseph Phelps Cabernet good. Duck fat fries decent but cold. I wish they served them hot. \\n\\nI racked up $800 for 3 people and I felt the food was ok, but the service and the wine service and the bar service was slow, unprofessional and terrible. They need to hire a floor manager and a janitor for the bathroom. I firmly believe a night can be worth $300 a person, but the value and service needs to be there.',\n",

Great beat & burrata salad, oysters, and mojitos too! I liked sitting at the tall bar tables too. It was a nice atmosphere and a very tasty time for about 40 dollars for 2 people!',\n",
       " \"Compared to other steak houses I've visited in Las Vegas, Stripsteak is middle-of-the-road. If I'm going to spend a lot of money I'd rather dine at Carnevino, Cut, or Delmonico. If I want a decent steak at a more affordable price, I'd go to Twin Creeks.\\n\\nMy wife and I arrived early -- about half an hour before our reservation. The hostess still seated us promptly at a small circular two-top, but in the back of the lounge, in between the bar and the main dining area. It was very comfy -- her on a long bench with big cushions, me in an oversized chair -- but not ideal for eating a meal because of how low the chairs are in relation to the table. Add to that the deafening sound of all the lounge chatter and music and it was difficult to have a conversation.\\n\\nThe food wasn't bad at all. As a matter of fact, some of it was great. But, I think there's better value to be had elsewhere.\\n\\nTo start you off, they bring out a complimentary trio of fries (Old Bay flavored, Garlic herb, and truffle oil). All were some of the best fries I've had, with the garlic herb being my favorite. They were perfectly crispy, light, and addictive. We had to force each other to stop eating them and save room for the rest of our food.\\n\\n//Appetizers//\\nSweet onion soup ($17) - morels, parmesan crouton. Excellent depth in flavors, earthy and delicious mushrooms.\\n\\nMain lobster fritters ($20) - bacon-wrapped fritters. Three per order. The lobster flavor was masked by the oiliness and saltiness of the dish. But the crispness and coolness of the lettuce wrap was a nice compliment. Not worth getting again.\\n\\n//Entree and sides//\\n10 oz. filet ($56). They were nice enough to split it for us since we wanted to share. Ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. Tender and savory, but not nearly as good as the filet at Carnevino.\\n\\nTwo sides of king crab ($24 ea.). Each order contained two meaty crab legs with lemon. Served cold, it could have benefitted from some drawn butter.\\n\\nShallot potato cakes ($9) - scallion creme fraiche. Three cakes. Perfectly crispy, great flavor... kinda like the greatest hash browns you'll ever have.\\n\\nEnglish peas ($14) - shaved fennel, pancetta. Peas are peas, nothing extraordinary, but the pancetta added a good bit of savoriness and salitness.\\n\\nOverall, the food was pretty good, service not very attentive, the sommelier suggested a wine we weren't crazy about, seating was comfy but not functional, and it was too loud to carry a conversation. Oh, and I forgot pricey. But we did have a $50 restaurant.com gift card that helped mitigate the damage.\\n\\n3.5 Stars\",\n",

       " \"Recently went to Strip Steak on a quick weekend getaway and already wanting to go back! As some have noted below, we printed the Restaurant.com $50 dollar gift certificate and had no problems using it. I had made a reservation a couple weeks before on their online site, but when we arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday, they seemed to have plenty of tables available. \\n\\nGot our complimentary duck fries and they were D-E-E-E-licious. Our waiter Glen ran through the list of daily specials, but we already knew exactly what we wanted (I always come prepared.. haha). I got the 10oz filet with the mac and cheese and my fiancé got the Kansas City Strip with the scalloped potatoes. I was surprised by how fast we got our food (although like I said.. the restaurant was maybe 3/4 full). The mac and cheese seemed to be plentiful (although it was so delicious I wanted to eat it all by myself!) but the scalloped potatoes (IMO) wouldn't have been enough for just the two of us to split, so I'm glad we got two sides. My medium rare filet was so good that I was getting depressed eating that last piece. Service was excellent, always filling our drinks and coming by to ask if we needed anything else. Used our coupon and had no problems with that. Didn't have any room for dessert, although I think we would have had we not filled up on Fat Tuesday drinks beforehand! The place was a little noisy, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner, this is probably not the place for you. We were looking for delicious food to fill up on and not a conversation. :P Overall, a wonderful experience and dinner and I will absolutely make it a stop on my next trip to Vegas!\",\n",
       " 'Excellent food, modern (somewhat casual for a steakhouse) atmosphere, excellent service. They serve a trio of fries instead of bread when you first sit down. Two of them are good, but the truffle fries with truffle aioli is amazing. Wedge salad was good but nothing special. Beet and burratta salad was delicious (very soft, delicate mozzarella). Fillet was simple, but perfect. Mac and cheese with truffle oil is amazing, but very filling. Artichoke hearts with goat cheese is good, but nothing special compared to the mac and cheese. The asparagus was good, but falls in third place for the sides (behind the artichoke and goat cheese). Save room and get the beignets with creme brule to finish things off.',\n",
       " \"This place was AMAZING. Up until I went to Stripsteak my favorite steak place was Cut by Wolfgang puck. But, given that everything here was amazing (the appetizers, main meal, sides AND desert) it is an overall winner and now at the top of my list. I'm just sad that it is in Vegas and not in LA. Also - I figured it was about $200 less than Cut for the same meal / alcohol combo. Be sure to get the donuts with dipping sauce at the end of the night!\",\n",
       " \"Really liked this restaurant. Some of the best steaks I've had. Extensive but expensive wine selection. If you are at Mandalay Bat it should be on the short list.\",\n",

       " \"The Skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don't order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) Service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) Value: considering the plethora of deals on Restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).\\n\\nMy hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at Stripsteak.\\n\\nAfter passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. By our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. She basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. \\n\\nShe also didn't tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. Plus, they don't offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you're seated at the table. For this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.\\n\\nMichael Mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. So obviously our amuse bouche consisted of Bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. The fries had a lovely crispness that retained its texture even when it cooled off. The sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. I considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided I still needed to save my appetite for food we'd ordered. \\n\\nThe soups were solid but nothing special. The vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. The seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.\\n\\nThe foie gras sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. The plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.\\n\\nBy far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. It's rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher's mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. Yes, it is that good. The carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it's hard to find steak that well-prepared. \\n\\nIt was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. The peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. The truffled mac 'n cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. Unfortunately, the creamed spinach had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.\\n\\nThe hubby's grilled chicken (they don't fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. Half a grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac 'n cheese. Who wouldn't like this?\\n\\nWe topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. We loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. The chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.\\n\\nOverall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the Restaurant.com certificate. We ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (foie gras $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). Subtract the $50 Restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. Definitely a solid four star review.\",\n",

The servers paid attention to detail, had the right amount of \"chat\" in them, and didn\\'t give off any stuffy vibes for a place that is priced at that level. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is underrated. I thought that the open feel was nice; instead of going with the \"modern\" color tones, the wood feel of the side wall (a giant Jenga piece) kept the balance between old-world and new-world. The chairs were VERY comfortable to sit on (and I\\'m a big guy). This is an important detail after being stuffed.\\n\\nThe food was a notch below \"the best.\" This is not a slight on this restaurant. I just happen to reserve my \"Best\" label for only the 2-3 elite few restaurants. The meat was a little overseasoned for my taste buds (as was my wife\\'s). The sides were delicious. Our favorite was the Jalapeno Creamed Corn - yum! The Truffled Mac and Cheese was really good too. The trio of mashed potatoes is a safe choice if you are looking to go that route. Our appetizer, the Hamachi, was decent. The flavor profile of the fish and the seasoning (fresh) was good - however, it just didn\\'t fit with our steak and potatoes type of meal.\\n\\nI would come here again.

       " 'I had read some reviews citing poor service at Stripsteak due to what reviewers believed was a result of their servers writing them off as \"not going to spend much\"-type customers, even when the bill was in the range of $200 for two. Having read this, as well as the $110/person \"average check price\" listed on their website, I was somewhat concerned going in, given I had intended on trying the prix fixe menu at $55/person and arriving a bit earlier in order to get some drinks on their happy hour menu. However, I love steak and we were staying at THEhotel, so I really wanted to try an upscale steakhouse nearby, and Stripsteak sounded great for the price.\\n\\nWhen we got there, there was a slight wait even though we had reservations and the place was clearly empty (common restaurant tactic in order to drive patrons to wait/drink at their bar, which we did). It wasn\\'t a problem as we were planning on trying some of their specialty cocktails on their happy hour menu anyway, and I had budgeted plenty of time for dinner before our Lion King show later in the night. We got to chat up two of the bartenders over a mojito and Stripsteak Sour. Drinks were okay; nothing out of this world. The bartenders were pretty outgoing, though it was obvious they were tired of hearing about what tourists had planned for their trips, even so, they continue to ask.\\n\\nI have to say, our waiter (Glen H) was awesome the whole night. He was extremely attentive, and we didn\\'t notice any decline in service after we had ordered our meal. He answered questions on the menu items (which I always have at these type of places where they have fancy names for everything), and was around just enough but not too much.\\n\\nFood is served with a complimentary trio of duck fat fries, which were amazing. I ordered the prix fixe menu as planned and chose the salad wedge, prime rib, and root beer float dessert. My girlfriend ordered the Kobe burger with a side of duck fat fries (we didn\\'t know we would be getting complimentary fries before we had ordered, and she really wanted to try them).\\n\\nThe meal was excellent. The duck fat fries were a perfect start and the prime rib was surprisingly filling (I got triple sides of mac n cheese as well lol). The root beer float was not my thing. To be honest, I\\'m not sure how different you can do a root beer float, so I found it somewhat uncharacteristic of this type of restaurant.\\n\\nAll in all, we kept the bill to $150, and that\\'s with four drinks (a head\\'s up, the specials go from $6 to $13 after 7pm, which I hadn\\'t noticed before we had ordered our seconds). We even had leftovers, though I warn that duck fat fries do not taste good at all cold, so kill these at the restaurant (the fat begins to harden).\\n\\nI think the prix fixe menu served its purpose in wetting our appetite for Stripsteak.

       " \"i am still dreaming about that 18oz rib eye that i inhaled last december....\\n\\noh yes, it is THAT good.  when i eat steak, i am normally put off by if it is kind of hard and dry, if it is overcooked, etc, etc, etc...i am pretty picky and can't eat more than 3-5oz of steak when it isn't done well or if it isn't tender enough...\\n\\ni have no idea where they got the meat and what the heck they did do it but DAMN whatever it is, wow.  if only they had another location in Los Angeles, i think i would eat here at least once every 2-3weeks!  i get to go to Vegas 2times a year for business and the hubby and i snuck out of town on a last minute whim and ended up at the Mandalay Bay.  he is a steak man so we decided to try this place and our eyes bulged when i saw the prices.\\n\\nBUT, this is Vegas after all, and after all the crappy uber expensive restaurants i have tried at the Palazzo like Carnevino and Morels (which SUCKED SUCKED SUCKED and you totally get ripped off) the prices here are downright reasonable!  \\n\\nwe almost ate at BOA Steakhouse at the Caesars Palace which i tried before and was pretty happy with...this place is A LOT BETTER!  \\n\\nmy hubby ordered the 30oz porterhouse while i had the prix fix menu and upgraded to the rib eye....we both ate in bliss, and i have to say the quality of the meat made every bite worth it and money extremely well spent.  \\n\\nhonestly, the soup was so so, the 3 types of fries was DELISH, the bread was meh...it truly was all about the steak.  \\n\\nit was prepared so well, and the tenderness, and the taste...hard to do justice -and the best part is by reading the other reviews i was clued in to the restaurant.com discount so for my next trip to vegas this july i pd $20 for a $50 gift card...SO SO SO SO SO SO awesome!  \\n\\nthank you yelp and yelp reviewers...\\n\\nfor anybody that really enjoys a great cut of steak that is expertly cooked, forgot all the other places, this is THE place to go.  worth every penny.  me and the hubby had to practically roll ourselves out of there and we had two giant grins from ear to ear that lasted for days because of this meal.  \\n\\n5stars for sure!  if i could give it 6 or more i totally would!\",\n",
       " 'We had a reservation on a Sunday night at 8:30.  We got there a little early and sat at the bar.  They said they were running behind a bit.  The drinks at the bar were excellent.  I had a blueberry type martini and my friend had just her usual vodka soda.  We asked for some of the fries they give out since we were starving and they finally brought some after about 20 minutes and they were cold.  Still good though.  I struck up a conversation with another customer at the bar, discussing his wine choice.  We were seated at 9pm.  The customer at the bar followed me and yelled at me \"Are you just going to walk away?\"  I was a little freaked out by that, it was weird, but not the restaurants problem and he left right away.   Somebody brought more of the complimentary fries, a bit warmer than the last.  Male waiter took our order, food runner brought it, a half hour later, and we never saw our waiter again until he returned and spilled a glass of water all over my friend.  Service is simply awful here.  NO EXCUSE at this price point. I don\\'t blame the service staff this is a management problem.  They are understaffed.  We know what you pay these workers.  Add a few more.\\nThe food was excellent.  We each had a steak and shared the beet salad and the mac and cheese.  The food is worth returning for, but at that price you can get food just as good and impeccable service to go with it.  Think I will stick to the Wolfgang Puck restaurants where you get both.',\n",

Disappointed in the fact that there are no soft drink refills which  Ithought was bizarre for Vegas. Overall, a decent meal even though it was overpriced.

       " 'Have I been living like a baller the past couple days or what? \\n\\nFather in law is staying at Mandalay Bay for a convention this week, so after watching the Tigers game at the sports book, we ventured out to find some grub and a few drinks for catching up. After looking at several menus we decided on Strip Steak. Wife\\'s pops is probably the biggest fan of steak in the world. Yeah, you\\'ve probably met a steak lover before. Not like this guy though. \\n\\nFor starters, the place is right off the restaurant mall-ish area when you are walking from the casino back to wards the shark reef and chapel are. Familiar to me since I GOT MARRIED THERE! It is a little loud and not as intimate as your typical high end steak house, but that is to be expected considering the location and the fact it\\'s called \"Strip\" Steak. \\n\\nVery extensive wine and cocktail list sure to please anything you\\'d crave. The dinner menu was impressive as well, featuring a massive selection of steaks from any quality and cut you could imagine. There were also your typical sea food selections and the ala-carte sides you\\'ve grown to love from a nice steak house, baked potatoes, creamed spinach, etc. Let us get back to the important part - the steaks. \\n\\nWe were lucky enough to be sat close enough to see the giant wood fire grill system set up in the kitchen and the meat lockers with giant slabs of meat. Now that sounds pretty weird, but it\\'s cool to see them wheel the grills up and down while your choice cut is being prepared. In theory, they could put a name-tag on your selection and you could watch them cook it. \\n\\nOur table ordered the east coast oysters of which I only had one. It was perfect though. The wedge salad looked impressive, but had a cheap store bought like bleu cheese dressing instead of the crumbled bleu cheese you\\'d expect on a steak house chop salad. Pass. \\n\\nI selected the bone in rib-eye. It was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The steak was well marbled, just the right amount of char, and seasoned the way a steak should be. No fancy sauces tonight. I also had the creamed spinach I mentioned above, and it wasn\\'t that good. They sprinkled what seemed like bacos (gross) on the top, which were really pointless. Also, they spinach was not as creamy as a creamed spinach should be. Am I being picky about spinach? I suppose, but for as proud of the menu (think $$$$) as this place was, they better do it all right. \\n\\nOverall it was a great meal. I had a few cocktails from the bar, and my two counterparts enjoyed some wine. The cocktails are served with one giant ice cube which is an interesting touch, as it did not water  down my drink as fast as a normal ice having drink would have. \\n\\nI saved the best for last. When your server hands you your menus, there is a snack of three types of fries served at the table, with three dipping sauces. One set of fries is fried in duck fat. Absolutely NOT gross. Paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were probably the best fries I\\'ve ever had in the history of me eating fries. They were so good I almost ordered a hamburger at a steak house, just so I could have the side of fries it would have come with. \\n\\n4 stars out of 5 for the creamed spinach thingy and the less than impressive wedge salad. \\n\\nNote: If you\\'re an out of town-er looking for a pregame meal before your main event of a drink filled excellent adventure on the strip, you could do much worse, and I can\\'t imagine you could do a ton better. Great service, nice bar, and even with a convention in the same building were able to seat us without a reservation.',\n",
       " 'After reading about this place, I knew it would be something good! \\n\\nStripsteak is located in Mandalay Bay, where all the restaurants are, before the Mandalay Bay conference rooms and ballrooms. \\n\\nWhen you walk up (hopefully with reservations as this place gets BUSY!) there is a full bar with a seating area. Luckily, we were able to get a table without reservations at 7:00pm on a Monday night. They sat us at a nice table, right in the middle of the action. It\\'s a tad loud in there so bring your listening skills. \\n\\nAfter you are seated and given the menu, they bring out three little containers with french fries and dipping sauces. Now these are not your McDonald\\'s fries. These are the most amazing fries you will ever have. \\n\\nThe first one had french fries with old bay seasoning and a mustard herb dipping sauce. \\n\\nThe second one had french fries with oregano and ketchup. \\n\\nThe third one was knock-your-socks off amazing. French fries in duck fat with truffle dipping sauce. Are you fucking kidding me?!?! The minute we all tried these we all looked at each other and said \"these are goddamn delicious!\" \\n\\nAll three had fantastic flavor with good crisp on the outside. \\n\\nBut yea- duck fat + french fries + truffle = smiling faces. \\n\\nOur table ordered: \\nStarters- \\nOysters (in a half shell)- east coast style. They ask you if you want them east coast or west coast style. The difference? east coast are \"larger and briny-er\", west coast are \"smaller and sweeter\" according to our server. \\nThe oysters were delicious! They had came with cocktail sauce, lemon, and other toppings. The cocktail sauce had some nice horseradish in it for the perfect combination. \\n\\nWedge Salad- bleu cheese, bacon & polenta croutons, red chili cucumbers. I was told that it was disappointing as the bleu cheese dressing didn\\'t have any bleu cheese chucks and tasted \"like it came out of the store\" \\n\\nMain- \\n18 oz. Dry-Aged Bone-In Rib Eye- heard it was delicious. They cook the steaks on this beautiful open flame wood burning grill. You can watch the chefs using the wheel up and down to get the steaks. Heard that the marble was good and had great char on the steak. Nothing fancy just cooked perfect (medium-rare plus) \\n\\n16 oz. Kansas City Strip- great char, great flavor, all round good steak. \\n\\nDiver Scallops- which is what I ordered. Four deliciously tender, cooked perfectly, great flavored scallops. Seared nicely. \\n\\nSides- \\nCreamed Spinach w/ bacon- I LOVE creamed spinach and this was up to par, but nothing crazy. The bacon doesn\\'t really add anything to the dish. \\n\\nRoasted Maitake Mushrooms- great roasted mushrooms. Not much else to say. They are always a good side to seafood and steaks. \\n\\nWe had a couple of glasses of wine (a cab-combination) that was REALLY GOOD and I would order all day long! \\n\\nI cannot WAIT to go back for more duck fat and truffle and oysters and more food in general!',\n",

Perfectly cooked.  Juicy.  Tender.  We ordered Asparagus in Horseradish Beurre Blanc and the Truffled Mac & Cheese as our sides.  The asparagus was fabulous.

I know I would've been happier with the Scalloped Potatoes, but hubby wanted to try the Mac, and it was his birthday, so...  Besides, I was too full from the complimentary fries to even get through the steak, so it was no problem to eschew (pun intended) the macaroni.\\n\\nThe service was terrific - not elegant, because this is a casual place, and that's just the way I like it.\\n\\nMy one nit-let about this very stylish space is the chairs.  They're very comfy, upholstered arm chairs.  But the arms are as high as the table tops, so I couldn't sit as close to the table as I like.

A little less salt and 2 more minutes cooking and this flavorful chicken would have been PERFECT. \\nthe sides of truffle mac n\\' cheese, mushrooms and cream corn were all good, but not spectacular. \\nRick had the Kansas steak.  cooked nicely and fresh and flavorful.

       " \"I arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. I mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn't stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did I want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. When the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.\\n\\nAs soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the Restaurant Week menu. As that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.\\n\\nWe also noticed a birthday card from the staff. Details, people, details!\\n\\nGetting to the good stuff (well, mostly):\\n\\nDuck-fat Fries (3.5/5) - The truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. The herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, STRIPSTEAK!). The last one, I can't remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don't like mustard). \\n\\nFoie Gras Sliders (1.5/5) - Ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the grilled foie gras they list as an extra. We were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. OK, we thought, we'll try it. Spoiler alert! It was still a single piece, just sliced in half. This made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. The bread (I tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. The garnishes were OK. A single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. Overall, high hopes dashed.\\n\\nDuck Spring Rolls (3.5/5) - Generous portion and, I was happily surprised, not too heavy. The wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. Again, however, it was not heavy. The crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. The meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. It was a bit dry in spots. I am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.\\n\\nHeirloom Tomato Salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - Fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn't weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.\\n\\nNY Strip (4/5) - Slightly overcooked based on our order. We were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. The sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.\\n\\nRoasted Chicken (4/5) - A tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. I love that they left the skin on; I don't eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. The truffled mac n' cheese (4/5) was really good. Almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it's own amazing profile.\\n\\nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Biegnets (5/5) - The brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. The biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. Another detail we thought was fantastic, sis's dessert came out presented with the words Happy Birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!\\n\\nWines (5/5, nail on the head every time). We started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of Gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish Oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. We spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked AND what we ordered). Given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.\\n\\nThe service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. There were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. \\n\\nAll in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.\\n\\nWith the Restaurant Week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional foie gras, our total was $300 and change. Bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!\",\n",
       " \"Review for Restaurant Week 2011 Menu:\\n\\nMy first time at Stripsteak and it was excellent!  I usually don't order steak out as it is almost always overcooked for me.  Based on the good reviews on Yelp, Stripsteak became an addition to my Restaurant Week list of places to go.\\n\\nAmuse bouche:  Three containers of seasoned fries - garlic herb, truffle, and bay-seasoned.  There were three containers for dipping the fries one mustard and bay seasoned, truffle aioli, and ketchup.  Pace yourself here.  All tables are served the amuse bouche in lieu of a bread basket.  Since I was alone, I could have totally pigged out on these tasty fries.  5/5\\n\\nCourse 1:  Duck spring rolls.  Duck confit with sweet and sour cherry drizzle.  The duck was excellent and what a great appetizer.  5/5\\n\\nCourse 2:  OK, so I decided to get a steak.  It was the Kansas City strip steak with small sides of creamed corn and mushrooms.  The steak had a grilled small red onion and a yellow tinkerbell pepper.  The pepper is very mild.  The steak was grilled exactly as I ordered - black and blue. 5/5\\n\\nCourse 3:  Beignets and vanilla creme brulee.  Perfect ending to the meal.  I forced myself - yeah right - to finish the beignets.  5/5\\n\\nAs mentioned in other reviews, when you get ready to leave, you're given a small bag of candy popcorn with the Stripsteak logo to take as a gift.  It will be a TV snack some night.\\n\\nMy server, Alexis, was always available and attentive.  When the two eating next to me left for a bathroom trip, she refolded their napkins while they were gone.  I noticed this attention to detail and good service throughout the night.  \\n\\nI was quite pleased to see the number of families with young, well behaved children.  There was a concert with someone named Selena Gomez at the Mandalay Events Center and thus the large number of children. Alexis had to explain to me who this Selena was.\\n\\nA great evening and another wonderful Restaurant Week experience!\",\n",
       " \"We had a great meal here but it definitely wasn't the 5-star experience I've come to expect of Michael Mina establishments.\\n\\nMaybe it was because we waited so long WITH a reservation and after coming back within 20 minutes, as they suggested, we waited about 10 more. Or the fact that we were seated right next to the entrance which didn't make for a romantic setting (more like mall dining despite the glass barrier). Or that we told a number of people it was our anniversary and no one acknowledged it despite all the other restaurants we visited during the anniversary trip doing so). Not sure...but our server was friendly, the recommended wine was tasty and the food was good so 4 stars you get.\\n\\nDuck Fat Fries trio=awesome.\\nWe adored the Tuna and Hamachi Poppers\\nWas shockingly not a fan of the duck spring rolls which were too gamey\\nMac and Cheese = most awesome\\nScallops were tasty but a little underdone for my tastes.\\nHusband like the steak but didn't find it super memorable.\\n\\nAll in all if you're in Vegas and want MM, I'd suggest Nob Hill Tavern instead.\",\n",
       " \"This was the first time I've been to Stripsteak, but it won't be the last. The hip and trendy setting is a perfect backdrop for an amazing dining experience. It does get loud in there so large tables can be hard to have conversations at.  The food is amazing. Period. I had the Sashimi to start and it blew me away. there was something that had a slight crunch in it that just turned this dish into gold. My Steak was perfectly prepared and seasoned - honestly one of the best steaks I've had. All the side dishes were just a perfect blend of ingredients and preparation. Total Yummitude!\",\n",
       " 'If I had written this after my first visit I would not have given it five stars. Yes, the duck fat fries were freaking amazing and some of the best this fry-junkie had ever tasted. But the steak I got, the porterhouse, was bland and tasteless and not even that tender. For that price and reputation, everything should be supreme. I was sorely disappointed. But my husband convinced me to go back, since we were staying at Mandalay Bay again, and he found an unbelievable deal on restaurant.com: $50 gift certificate for only $4. So I reluctantly agreed and boy, am I glad I did. \\n\\nWe sat down at the bar, because we arrived early for our 7pm reservation, and happily discovered happy hour was still in effect. So we got melon mojitos and stripsteak sours for just $6 each. We ordered a half dozen oysters and they were so clean tasting and delicious. They include like three different sauces but just a little squeeze of lemon and a dash of tabasco was perfect. The bartender, Anthony was funny and attentive.\\n\\nNow to dinner. Don\\'t love the tables and chairs, which resemble office lunchroom decor. But our server, Steven, was one of the best we\\'ve ever had. He was friendly, attentive, informative and generous. We told him about our last experience and he more than made up for it by comping two amazing $20 glasses of cab. I ordered the Kobe Rib \"Cap\"... 8 oz. for $67!!! I usually get my steaks medium rare, but Steven suggested medium plus, due to the marbling in the meat. And good god, it was THE best piece of meat I have EVER had. Perfect flavor and char. I didn\\'t think it was possible to make regular ribeye seem average, but THAT\\'s how good it was. Every. Delectable. Savory. Bite. FOODGASM. Multiple. We also ordered the jalapeno creamed corn, and creme brulee with beignets. Aaaah, I\\'m still thinking about it. When can I go back???',\n",
       " \"The five-star rating I give it isn't because the wait staff is phenomenal, they aren't, but because the food absolutely is. You will wait and wait, you will beg and ask the dishwasher to please dear God bring you your beer, but you will NOT leave disappointed in the food. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I went last night (Saturday evening) and the wait was non-existent. We were seated in a beautifully designed dining room at a large table. We waited and waited and waited on our first beer, but we were okay with that because we'd been at the bar drinking before dinner anyway. The waitress was polite enough and seemingly efficient, but then would wander away waiting on the tables around us while we fantasized about another drink. Eventually we got one more.  \\n\\nI don't want to harp on the waitstaff, but when you present a beautiful place with an outstanding menu (and wow, the prices) then you expect to be waited on accordingly. No, not here. Anyway, onto the real star, the meal!\\n\\nOrdered some East Coast oysters. The waiter said the oysters from the West Coast were smaller and we like our oysters to have something to bite into, so...Got the oysters and they were TINY. I don't want to know what the West Coast were like. Regardless, these were the best oysters I do believe I've ever had the pleasure of eating. There weren't enough, and in my estimation, with the way those tasted, never will be enough. I could have eaten them for days. As Rowan Jacobsen says 'at some level, it's not about taste or smell at all. Because an oyster, like a lover, first captures you by bewitching your mind.' These are those oysters. Get them.\\n\\nWe then ordered the 18 oz. dry aged bone-in rib eye. Wow, wow, wow. WOW. It came out cooked a little more rare than we asked (medium rare), and while usually that much red in meat makes me shy away, it was hardly relevant with this steak. It melted in my mouth. Every taste was better than the one before. I have never, ever eaten a steak that tasted this way. I was considering going full vegetarian, but after this steak there will never be a chance of that. I have eaten at Cut, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, BLT, and many, many more. None have ever come close to the steak I had at STRIPSTEAK. None. As a bonus, my BF ordered foie gras to go on top. Listen, if you asked me to trade sex for a year for all the foie gras I could eat from this restaurant, well, let's just say I'd miss my BF a lot. It was THE best thing that has ever touched my lips and I mean that with everything I have. If you don't get this you are missing out on the most divine dining experiences you could possibly have. I have to stop talking about it. Moving on...\\n\\nI can't skip the sides we had with our fabulous meal. The potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish) was, as stated, a puree, and I tend to like my mashed potatoes with a little more body, but these were out of this world. The flavors were subtle and smooth, and really, now I'll never want to eat garlic mashed again. THANKS A LOT, STRIPSTEAK. We also had the truffled mac and cheese. Speechless. It was the most divine taste of truffles in any dish I've ever tried with them. The musky, earthy flavor was just enough. I ate the whole thing (sorry, honey). \\n\\nOkay, the letdown here was the dessert, but you really don't go for the dessert anyway, right? While I don't remember what they called it, we had miniature donuts with a couple of dipping sauces. While I've had this dessert elsewhere and loved it, here it fell flat and really shouldn't be on a menu as amazing as this. Avoid. \\n\\nMy suggestion is, if you want to round out your experiences with great steak RUN, don't walk, here. This place sets the bar for it.\",\n",
       " 'My boss took a bunch of us here when we were in town. I was very impressed, great steak. Lived up to the hype of a celebrity chef restaurant. The fries and dipping sauces were as good as advertised. Great design and layout. Service was excellent.',\n",
       " \"This place is a solid 3 *.  When I ate here a few times a few years back I was blown away with the food and service.  But when we returned this past weekend for a bachelorette party, I wasn't so impressed.  My friend and I shared the Kansas Strip steak which was delicious, however we ordered the steak medium rare and it came out more like rare.  Another friend ordered her steak medium well, which I found crazy, but it came out medium rare....you'd think a fancy smancy steakhouse like Stripsteak would know the difference between medium rare, rare and medium well...the sides were awesome...we had asparagus, mushrooms and the truffle mac n cheese.  5* for that side!\\n\\nthe cocktails and wine list is yummy, the food is good, but not great.\",\n",

Our server was very nice, and ended up actually being from Hawaii (I think his name is Brian), so that was nice!\\n\\nWe pretty much knew what we were going to order, since we studied their menu before our trip!!  He got the 30oz Porterhouse, and I got the Veal Chop.  For sides, we ordered their Truffled Mac & Cheese and Scalloped Potatoes.  Of course we got their complimentary Duck Fat Fries, which were effin\\' awesome with their little dipping sauces...I had a glass of wine and he, a beer.\\n\\nOur food was very good, my BF ate ALL of his steak - and it was a huge one!!  I had a bite, and it was delicious.  So was my Veal Chop - it was big, and I couldn\\'t finish it, but that\\'s what BFs are for ~ he ate the rest of my chop with no problem!  Our sides were good too...I especially loved the Truffled Mac & Cheese, but then again - I love anything with truffles!!  The Scalloped Potatoes were good, but even though it\\'s prepared differently - I seem to eat it a lot at my mom\\'s house since her only grandson (AKA the \"Golden Child\") loves to eat it!  So, I\\'m kinda over scalloped potatoes...no matter the place I\\'m eating at!\\n\\nAnyway, I really liked our experience at STRIPSTEAK and would return in a heartbeat!!',\n",
       " \"Solid,  that pretty much sums up this place.\\n\\nI got the new york (which is pretty much what i get at every steak place),  and it turned out pretty much how i would expect the average 50 dollar steak to taste like.  Good but not amazing.  \\n\\nThe service was also on par for this type of restaurant.  I actually came here twice and both times I had a good experience.   Which i guess in itself is quite the feat since it's pretty rare for me to visit one of these places more then once AND not be disappointed the second time around.\",\n",
       " \"Yum-o.  From the complimentary duck fat fries to the mouth-watering mac and cheese, michael mina's Stripsteak satisfied every taste bud on my palate.  Instead of bread, you are greeted with a complimentary trio of duck fat fries with truffle sauce, homemade ketchup, and an aioli.  Those fries...seriously once I started I just couldn't stop eating!  The truffle sauce rich but so flavorful.  Next, we shared the 18 oz rib eye and the braised veal chop.  The 18 oz dry aged rib eye was simple, without the excessive spice mixture coating or butter drenching the meat, and yet so delicious that you could really appreciate the meat itself.  Cooked to perfection!  The braised veal chop fell right off the bone, however was on the saltier side.  To compliment these large slabs of meat was the star side...the truffle mac and cheese.  A blend of broccoli, macaroni noodles, and cheeses smothered in a coating of cheese (I think it was mizithra), this was the best mac and cheese I've tasted, and I couldn't stop eating it (yes it is a recurrent theme in this write-up).  I was so full after finishing my veal chop and mac and cheese that I couldnt make it to dessert, but I'll definitely be back for more.\\n\\nThe only cons is the atmosphere.  The decor of the restaurant appears cheap for a michael mina restaurant.  And, it's unisex restrooms!  Come on...at least have separate restrooms so I'm not avoiding urine on the floor on my trek to the toilet!\",\n",

For apps, the lobster fritters and duck spring rolls were spot on with flavors. For entree, I ordered the 10oz Filet Mignon with creamed corn and asparagus. The Filet was so nice n' tender and cooked consistency throughout. This is the reason why I eat meat!!!\",\n",

We ordered:\\n\\nFoie Gras sliders - really good!! the foie gras was grilled well, served with a kind of apple chutney. Delicious! I didn't care much for the sauce on the side.\\n\\nShabu Shabu - meh.. The kobe slices were a bit blah once boiled in the broth. Broth was really tasty tho..\\n\\nAmerican Kobe Rib Cap - Amazing! I am still dreaming about this. 3 out of 4 of us ordered this. The meat is grilled till there is a nice crust on the outside giving it amazing smoky flavour. Seasoned so well, marbled with so much fat that is was ultra tender.\\n\\nKansas City Strip w Grilled Foie Gras - Very good. The steak was cooked as requested and seasoned well. The foie was amazing quality, not a hint of vein spotted and grilled perfectly. \\n\\nRoasted Mushrooms - meh... most disappointing. Rubbery and unimpressive.\\n\\nTruffle Mac & Cheese - delicious but the macaroni was way overcooked and soft but it was very tasty! the little bits of broccoli was a nice surprise and gave it a nice edge.\\n\\nBeignets & Vanilla creme brulee - delicious! the creme brulee acted as a dip for the great beignets\\n\\nService was OK, not stellar but not overly absent. we didn't even get check backs to see how the food was. But bussers were great with clearing dishes and refilling drinks. I had a tad too many floaties (cork bits) in my wine and could not locate the waitress to get it changed for the longest time.\\n\\n The restuarant.com coupon is a no brainer since it takes barely any effort and a savings of $30~ Overall great meal and pretty worth the hefty price tag since everything is above average or excellent.\",\n",

In Las Vegas there are so many amazing restaurants that they each need to compete to stay on top, or at the very least - relevant. I didn't feel that Stripsteak was even trying. \\n\\nThe decor made me feel like I was in a cafeteria. The way the tables were placed and the type of chairs they had looked like a food court in a mall or cafeteria. It wasn't impressive at all. The menu didn't have anything on it that really stood out to me either. It was a standard Steak House menu- which isn't something to complain about, since I love steak, but the steak I had wasn't even that good. - A little background on me- it takes a lot for me to dislike any steak. I love steak. This steak in particular was just BORING. It wasn't cooked Medium Rare- it was more on the medium well side- which is fine too, but when you're paying $50 for a steak it should probably be cooked the way you requested. It also lacked flavor. It was just blah. I never in my life had such an expensive boring meal. \\n\\nThe upside- the french fries. The different french fries that they bring to each table as opposed to bread are phenomenal- and also the reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1. \\n\\nI'm sorry to the Stripsteak fans, but for me Stripsteak is a massive let down.\",\n",

It took 50 minutes for carpaccio and a wedge salad. Seriously... they didn't have to cook anything. My fillet was good but nothing special.

The spinach and mushroom sides sucked! Soooo not worth the amount we paid! Trust me bring your money somewhere else!\",\n",
       " \"There are three things that are a must for any Vegas trip... \\n\\n1) Hot sweaty dance floor action \\n\\n2) Titties at the Rhino \\n\\n3) A big fat juicy piece of meat from Stripsteak\\n\\nAs far as the steaks go, my personal recommendation would be to get the 18 ounce dry aged bone-in ribeye ($52).  Its fatty, flavorful, and absolutely satisfying, but If that's not enough for you, Stripsteak also offers a much larger 30oz Porterhouse ($69). And for those who want a little slice of heaven you can opt for the 12 oz gold label kobe steak for a whopping $85.  Might as well right...\\n\\nAnd we all know that no steak dinner is complete without a few sides.  My faves include teh the scalloped potatoes and the truffled mac and cheese.  I would say that one side per person is about right, but keep in mind that they do send over complimentary duck fat fries to get the juices flowing while you wait for you steak.\\n\\nIf you're in a rush and want your steak pronto let them know you have to catch a show and they'll throw that sucker on the grill and have it ready for you in no time. Oh and before you head over to Mandalay make sure to hit up restaurant.com for a $50 gift certificate.  \\n\\nBelow I have also included some eating instructions for you.\\n\\nAs soon as your steak arrives please take the following steps to ensure maximum satisfaction. \\n \\n1. cut your steak one bite at a time \\n\\n2. do not stop eating until you have finished you entire steak (fat included)\\n\\n3. once you finish your steak begin to eat the steak off of your dining companions plates.\\n\\n4. If they resist stab them in the neck with your knife then proceed to eat their steak as they bleed out.\",\n",
       " \"Based on the name, I came here thinking that I was going to get steak and a strip show, but alas the servers kept their clothes on. Good thing the food is excellent. \\n\\nAll kidding aside,  I love this place. One of my favorite stops in Vegas. I've been twice so far, and I plan to go back. First off, this place is currently on restaurant.com, so you can get a pretty good deal. I've tried both the ribeye and the rib cap. The rib cap is supposed to be their best meat they have, and it is rich and flavorful. However, I guess I'm a traditionalist and love my ribeye. It's very good here. The sides are incredible. I've had the mac and cheese, the trio of pureed potatoes (good!), and the creamed spinach with bacon. Also, the foie gras was very tasty and a generous portion. I tried the bone marrow for the 1st time in my life, and I just think I'm not a big fan of it.  As you must already know by reading the many reviews, they bring a complimentary trio of fries that come with special sauces. Oh, the truffles fries and truffle sauce... amazing. For dessert, I've had the marscapone cheesecake and the donuts. Both were very good. And they even give you a dark chocolate covered popcorn goodie bag to take with you.\\n\\nThe drinks are good too, and the service is great. Both times I came alone, and I felt very special. They are very accommodating.  \\n\\nGreat place!\",\n",
       " \"We did my daughter's Sweet 16 dinner here.  The food was great and our waiter took great care of us.  We premade a menu for the kids from their menu and limited the choices down to make ordering for our large group easier.  The portions are large so we rounded down the orders and did it family style.  It was great and they helped us pull it all off well.\",\n",
       " \"The good here was great, but the service needed a bit of work. There was a group of 9 of us, and the majority had steak. I had the 18oz bone in rib eye and it was as big as it sounds but so delicious. The sides that we ordered were truffle mac and cheese (really good), bacon cream spinach, mushrooms and the potato trio (yummy!). I also had the Apple crumble for dessert which was really big and pretty good. I've had better apple crumble but it wasn't bad by any means. The coffee was decent as well. Nothing to rave about, but nice to have at the end of your meal. Our server was slow on refilling our drinks and bringing the condiments we requested. The free fries at the beginning are such a nice touch and SO good. The meal will run your at minimum probably about $80 a person. Definitely worth the price though. Especially if your suite has a microwave or stove - take home the leftovers for steak and eggs the next morning! Oh, my husband had to lamb and said it was the best cut of lamb he's ever had but he didn't like the spices. The lobster was really good (although I don't think it was two pounds like they claimed) and the foie gras was really good to accompany your steak. You get a large peice for $19.\",\n",

I had a gift certificate from restaurant.com, so that helped on the bill a bit. \\n\\nFor Christmas night, it was surprisingly busy.  There was no special menu offered.  I will say, the set up in the restaurant is a little crowded. We couldn't help hearing the couple seated next to us bicker drunkenly, and were amused (and horrified) when the woman picked up her steak bone and proceeded to gnaw on it.  The music playing in the background was also a bit strange.  At first, we thought it was coming from elsewhere, but no, it was within the restaurant.  A mixture of club/pop/hip hop, which I didn't mind, but thought it odd for an upscale restaurant.  It wasn't playing loudly, however.\\n\\nAs always, the duck fat fries were delicious. I could eat them all day! The sauces were a nice compliment as well.  I ordered the scallops and a lobster tail, and we ordered the truffle mac and cheese as a side.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and a nice size (4 of them), and the lobster tail was tasty as well.  I found the sauce to be a bit oily, however.  The mac & cheese was also very good, but it too seemed a bit oily.  \\n\\nService was pretty good, leisurely pace, but they did forget to refill my iced tea, even after I requested another.  Small glitch, but I did notice.\",\n",

I bought a restaurant.com certificate before our trip and this was the first one we used. \\n\\nWe made reservations for 6pm and were promptly seated. It took a little while for our server to actually come over to the table and ask what we would want for drinks. I read reviews beforehand that warned about slow service. After we took some time to look over the menu and decided what we wanted we were given Duck Fat Fries with three sauces. These are amazing and I do hope that people get a chance to try them.\\n\\nFor my appetizer I ordered the Maine Lobster Fritters, which were to die for. For dinner I had the Braised Pork Shank, others in my park had the 12 oz. Skirt Steak, American Kobe Burger, and Golden Trout. We also ordered some sides such as the potato, asparagus, and spinach souffle. All the main entrees and sides were to die for. I think my mother-in-law was the only one who did not absolutely love their food. She got the Golden Trout and just thought it was ok.  The food was cooked perfectly. My Braised Pork Shank just fell off the bone and my husband was in love with the American Kobe Burger.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a cheap place to eat this is not it but it is worth every dime.

It is the fattiest but also the best.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\nAmerican Kobe Rib Cap w Foie Gras - top pick! as mentioned before, it was heaven in my mouth and the foie gras is top quality!\\nAmerican Kobe Rib Eye - Not as good as the rib cap. it is leaner and not as rich but still marbled and better than the average rib eye\\n2 lb Grilled Lobster special- great but incomplete by itself.\\nSkirt Steak - PRetty tough but is expected of skirt steak.

       " \"I had a very good meal here, but nothing blew me away. Given the reputation of the chef and the price paid, that is disappointing. My friend and I were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. Dana White and a group of UFC fighters were dining in the restaurant as well during the time of our visit. In fact I came pretty close to smacking the guy in the crotch when he walked by our table and I was in mid stretch. So yeah, as other have mentioned, the tables are packed pretty close together here. In addition to nearly smacking a guy in the crotch, the closeness of the tables also meant hearing a lot of other people's conversations. The nice older woman next to us started to tell some of the most expletive filled stories after a few glasses of wine. I did like that it was a relaxed atmosphere for fine dining. My wrinkle free shirts hadn't stayed as wrinkle free as I would have liked in my luggage and being sort on time I put on a black t-shirt and tried for the Steve Jobs look. I thought I'd look out of place, but lots of people were dressed casually. \\n\\nOur server was in a bit of a rush at first. All of his tables were sat at the same time including ours, but later in the night, as things calmed down, he came over and chatted with us for a bit. The guy was right on with all his suggestions. The service was good overall. \\n\\nFor appetizers we had the lobster fritters and east coast oysters. The fritters were lobster wrapped in bacon, fried and served with butter lettuce and creme fraiche. You know anything made with that combination of ingredients is going to be good and it was, but it was just good. I'm not usually one to talk about the concept of a dish, but when I'm in a place like Stripsteak I am hoping for something unique. This dish didn't strike me as being anything that unique as much as it was a bunch of delicious stuff that got fried. We also received our complimentary fries and while they were all good, the one that really stood out was the truffled one.\\n\\nMy friend and I both had the bone-in ribeye as our entree. Hate to say it, but it was slightly overcooked. I kept cutting into it hoping it was just the char from the wood burning grill that made it seem less pink than a medium rare should have been, but my steak was mostly medium until I got very close to the bone. This was a shame since it was a very good cut of meat. My friend had his with foie gras and it was a great combination. He also had the chipotle scalloped potatoes recommended by our server and they were excellent. I went old school and got a baked potato. The overcooked steak was probably the biggest disappointment of the night.\\n\\nWe were both stuffed, but after such a heavy meal I wanted something sweet to end the night. We both went with the beignets. I had the one with chocolate, pudding, and Macallan 18. I'll eat anything with Macallan 18 in it. It was a decent beignet. A little bit denser than I would have liked, but probably done so because it was intended to be dipped into the pudding. Again, a good dessert, but nothing amazing. The best part was probably the Macallan. My friend had the same thing but with creme brulee instead of pudding.\\n\\nSo yeah, that was pretty much the story of the night. Good food and good service, but nothing we had really wowed me. My friend raves about his steak with foie gras, but it was his first time having foie gras so I guess we all remember our first time ;) I think the only item that was really memorable to me was the truffled fries.\",\n",

       " \"Finally managed to make it outside the hotel on a program I worked in Vegas recently, and went to Mandalay to have Stripsteak with my sister in law. I'm not really sure what I was expecting (complete lack of expectation, I suppose) but I wasn't expecting to pay $50 for a small meal. My bad. Ordered the chicken on truffle mac'n'cheese, which was great... all $8 worth of it. Kind of wish I'd have just ordered a side of the mac'n'cheese since that was the best part of the whole dish. The duck-fat fry variety tray they bring out prior to the meal was the strangest free app I've ever had, but also perhaps one of the most delicious. Kind of a truffle whore, so when you give me truffle fries for free...you're alright in my book. Our waiter had excellent customer service and kept our table refreshed the whole time. Good service, good food, just bring your checkbook (figuratively)\",\n",
       " 'This might be the first time I\\'ve gone against the majority in a negative way. I had reservations as part of a package that included tickets to \"The Lion King\". So I had a pre fix menu to choose from. The decor inside the restaurant was nice, and everyone was friendly when I arrived. \\n\\nThe server was friendly, but a bit slow. I started my meal with the mushroom soup and also ordered the Lobster Fritters. The fritters where very tasty. That was by far my favorite pert of the meal. Then I tried the mushroom soup. Maybe my expectations where to high, but I just didn\\'t enjoy it. It was too creamy and barely served warm. No everything could be a winner tho. \\n\\nFor my entree I had the Skirt steak. Here is where they went from 4 stars to 2 stars. Normally I order my steak med-rare. My steak came out charred on top, and completely raw in the middle. I ate less then half of it, and had to give up the rest. I over herd my server talking to another table, saying that the steak is cooked under temperature, so I should have ordered it medium. Unfortunately, my server failed to mention this to me and got stuck with a tough, burnt tasting raw piece of meat. Not a winning entree. (It did taste great re hashed in my breakfast burrito the next morning however.)\\n\\nMy only dessert choice was a root beer float. Creative, if your 5 years old. Slow service and food below par. Maybe if I hadn\\'t been on a pre fix menu it would have been better. With all the choices in Vegas, It will be tough to get me back.',\n",

Food, service, price!\\nNow on to the actual review:\\n5:30pm reservation time, showed up early for a little HH cocktail and was promptly seated for dinner soon thereafter. Our server, although very soft spoken and a little difficult to hear, was attentive and nice! He gave us the perfect amount of time to order, and the food started to flow out of the kitchen.\\nCompliments from the chef: duck fat fries: hello?!? Heaven in my mouth!\\n1st course: Kobe beef tartare- beautiful presentation! Tartare came out on a plate with the quail egg set atop with all the mix ins surrounding. Our food runner gracefully mixed the tartare and placed it in a chilled glass. Grilled pita bread to go with. We both decided that the pita bread and the tartare were great........ Separately! The pita bread masked the steak when eated together.\\n2nd course (his): wedge salad: wow! Crispe cups of iceberg lettuce, bacon, blue cheese dressing (which was not too \"blue cheesy\"), and pickled shallots.\\n2nd (mine): hearts of romaine, which I automatically pegged for their version of a caesar salad. It was and it wasn\\'t. The menu states \"olive\" dressing....... After my first bite, I remembered that olives are not my most favorite....... My fault!\\nMain entree (his): rack of lamb. Perfect mid-rare with the most incredible rosemary sauce drizzled over the top.\\nMine: grilled scallops: cooked nicely...... Nothing over the top. My very last bite did have a grain of sand which sends chills down my spine, but it was just the one. I appreciate the work, talents, and dedication of the prep all the cooks/ chefs to back there do before service starts. One graine of sand won\\'t kill me.\\nSides: Brussels sprouts with bacon-de-lish! Potato purée: sour cream- average, lobster- incredible, horseradish- in between.\\nDessert (his): beignets with 18 yr scotch butterscotch pudding- the pudding was amazing. You got all the favors of both the scotch and the butterscotch. Perfect pair!\\nMine: mascarpone cheesecake: the best cheesecake I\\'ve ever had! Huckleberry compote, shortbread crumble, and candied kumquat peel...... Amazing!\\nall savory food came out very quickly, almost too quickly. By the time dessert came around, service drastically slowed down. As I stated at the beginning of this review, I\\'m in the industry, so I see both sides of it.\\nAt the end of the day, would I go back? Absolutely!!!\\nOther reviews state that the price is to high, blah, blah,...... But you need to remember, you\\'re not just paying for that steak on a plate..... You\\'re paying for the technique of food preparation, service and everything in between. So, if you\\'re worried about how much money you\\'re going to spend, don\\'t go out to a restaurant like this because you\\'ll leave pissed off when in all actuality everything was great until the bill was dropped. \\nI left happy! :)',\n",

It was a little bit burned on the outside and below rare on the inside.  The waitress made a pretty snobby comment when I asked for a new one \"You did ask for it medium-rare\" to which I replied \"I did, in which I\\'d expected it to be cooked\".

I do understand that a restaurant like this is not prepared to cater to vegans whatsoever, but as a fine dinning establishment, I do expect a higher standard for EVERYTHING that comes out of the kitchen.

We get there and had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated (when we got in, over half the tables were empty...) Whatever - thats fine. I got a little happy bday card from them and the waiter was really cool at first.

I would have rather had some bread.\\n\\nThen we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Gold Label Kobe NY and I told the waiter that I wanted the Kobe Rib Eye and then the waiter convinced me that I wanted the Kobe Rib Cap. I said that I wanted something super tender and buttery and he said definitely Rib Cap. We both ordered our steaks \"medium.\" We also got a baked potato and the bacon creamed spinach. I asked for a wine that went well with my steak and I said I normally drink white sweet wines but i would do a red wine if he could recommend one. He didn\\'t know anything about wine or he was being sort of condescending towards me bc I said that I never really drink red wine. I dunno. I just got a glass of riesling. \\n\\nThe food came out rather quickly - maybe thats because they barely cooked our steaks!! What the hell - they both came out RARE ( we ordered medium.) And this rib cap I got - it was super chunky and chewy and bloody - just not what I wanted at all :(  My boyfriends $85 steak was a bloody massacre. The inside was just pure mush- you couldn\\'t see any grain in the meat at all. My bacon spinach was almost too bacony- I LOVE bacon but the flavor overpowered the spinach. My boyfriend said his potato was good though and the sour cream that was served with it was delicious. \\n\\nSince I saw peoples\\' bday desserts from Yelp photos, I was waiting for them to bring me an ice cream or something. They didn\\'t, so I just ordered off the dessert menu - I got the Dunking Donuts- since our meals sucked, I was relying heavily on these donuts to make up for it!! These donuts literally took about 30 minutes to bring out - this took longer than the steaks lol. They wrote happy bday and I got my candle then we ate the donuts and... they were ok but I would have rather had Dunkin donuts or krispy kreme!!! When we ordered the donuts, we asked if they had vanilla (instead of the caramel that went with it) and they did. He asked if we wanted to swap it and I said I\\'d rather have just one caramel and one vanilla scoop. Who knew they would charge $5 for the little tiny scoop that was smaller than a teaspoon and that we demolished in one bite. lol. \\n\\nSo then we get the bill - $286.... yeah. thank goodness for the certificate we had then it came out to $236. We didn\\'t even order appetizers!!! They charged $24 just for water. They charged $12 for the little donut things plus the freakin $5 for like the smallest scoop of vanilla ice cream I\\'ve ever had in my life. This place is a rip off.

       " 'This is definitely a place that deserves an extra half star... 3.5. \\n\\nFOOD: Steak - had the 18oz Bone In Rib Eye... but it was fatty (not marbled) and I\\'ve definitely was disappointed by the cut.  It deserved 2 stars.  Wife had the Diver\\'s Scallops... These were awesome. 4+ stars when it came to flavor, portion size, etc. The sides were yummy too. Mushrooms and trio of potato purees... OMG.. The horseradish potatoes were amazing... so were the sour cream was. The Lobster one was a little \"fishy\" to me... Overall, because of the steak, the food was a 3. \\n\\nSERVICE: Good, solid and attentive... made sure my water was always filled and service was quick. 4. \\n\\nOverall, I thought that this place was decent. But for a steak place, I just expected more.',\n",
       " 'First off, for those that are confused - the Steaks at this restaurant do not actually strip, nor is this a strip club although there are several poles in the area which some guests seem to enjoy climbing onto.\\n\\nAnyway, when you enter this palace, you\\'re initially greeted by a waiter who while nice, has just enough condescension, and general annoyance at your hopefully great (and perhaps alcoholically induced) mood, to let it show. That\\'s the first mistake. These guys are not fun. They\\'re here to give you their song and dance on their Steak and other assorted bits and pieces. You better pay attention.\\n\\nAnd so they do...\"First, we spank the Cow for 30 days, until she is good and angry, and then we marinate her in a garlic olive oil arugula salad, while poking her with a pitch fork in a tub of fat-reduced sherry chutney, on top of a mound of butter farmed by orphans in Canada\"...ok, not exactly but that\\'s what it sounded like to me. It\\'s actually hard not to laugh at how serious they take their ridiculous and unnecessary explanation. And I think that I did. And that made our guy a little upset. Just something not quite elegant about all these little details. \\n\\nAnd then you see \"Lobster Fritters\" on the menu and you come full circle with the classless mess that is Stripsteak, where my fondest hope was that the Cow would indeed disrobe at the end of the story.\\n\\nThe Lobster Fritters (I personally did NOT order them) were ok. Kind of tasted like from frozen, but better quality than Weight Watchers. They come with Creme Fraiche so if you\\'re looking to die of heart disease before your 30 lbs of red meat, this is the appetizer to get.\\n\\nOysters were also just ok. Not fishy but just not great. And for 15-20 bucks, they should have been. Great, that is. They also only carry Kumamoto I believe, or some other mini Japanesey thing. Dude, Steakhouse - we need man Oysters here. Save these for your fake Sushi bar in the center of the hotel. (and they need it)\\n\\nSteaks do NOT come with condiments, so for a 50-60 dollar steak, assume another 20-30 bucks in potatoes and/or veggies. I had the scalloped something or other which was all in all - gross.\\n\\nThe Steak (Rib) itself was good. Was it 60 dollars good? No. But one of the better things to eat at Mandalay and that\\'s not saying much.\\n\\nThey also keep trying to push their stupid fake Kobe beef on you. Man - it\\'s not KOBE. Kobe beef is made under stringent and incredible conditions in Japan and Americans won\\'t let it in the country, as I hear. This is American FOBE. So don\\'t get sucked in. The cow did not drink any beer before getting massaged, and tattooed like they do in Tokyo. \\n\\nThe other thing we noticed is that its the busboys, both here and at China Grill, that do the place justice from a service perspective. Our busboy (busman really) - Victor, was awesome, fun, polite, respectful and free of that ever present Vegas-condescending, elitist attitude that is spread around the hotel, and inhaled by most staff members.\\n\\nIf you need to have Steak at Mandalay, go here if you don\\'t want to walk for 4 minutes to Charlie Palmer at the adjoining 4 Seasons. Otherwise, walk on by',\n",
       " \"So either I'm crazy, I had an unusually bad experience, or I've just eaten at some really good steak houses and this one does not compare to those AT ALL.\\n\\nHere's my story:  made a reservation, got a great seat by the window so we could people watch, table was ready when we got there [good], and then everything went wrong from here.\\n\\nTook a friend of mine here from San Diego, I live close to Mandalay Bay, & I had a $50 Restaurant.com certificate, so it was a logical choice. My only downfall was I took her to Panevineo the night before so the dining experiences were extremely different.\\n\\nThey don't serve bread to start, but rather french fries. Interesting. Making America fatter, I dig it!  I have never seen this before, I'd rather eat these with my meal then prior, but whatever. Fries were great! I mean they weren't McDonald's fries but they were dang tasty.\\n\\nOrdered 2 cocktails, one with a splash of cranberry [that never happened], limes in the cocktails were actually quite gross. They looked old and discolored they had been cut days prior and when we got brave enough to squeeze them into our drinks like 2 drops of juice came out.\\n\\nWe ordered a stripsteak, lamb chops, and brussel sprouts [see pix].  Lamp chops came out extremely under done since my friend is Greek and ordered them well done, her mom likes to over cook lamb and that's how she's used to eating it.  She put some brussel sprouts on her plate and then we proceeded to hunt for our waitress so we could get the problem rectified.  Friend starts  eating the side dish on her plate, flag down a bus boy, who tells another waiter, waiter comes and removes her plate from in front of her--doesn't even offer to get her a side plate so she can continue to nibble, but says they'll bring out more sprouts. \\n\\nNow she has no food, no bread, so she's staring at me. Naturally, I offer some of my meal to her she starts eating some of my steak [fine].  About 10 mins later lamb comes back ready to be eaten.....no sprouts???? About 10 mins after that round 2 of sprouts appear.  OK so their preparation is interesting on this as well, they shave the sprouts so they remind you of cole slaw????  Add bacon and then drowned them in butter. Like there is a pool of butter on the bottom of the dish. Not my favorite. My strip steak was ok, but it needed chimichurri.  There wasn't really a selection of sauces you could put on your steak much like you would see at STK or other fine places in this city.  Menu was rather limited and lacked depth to me.\\n\\nNo apologies for food, etc [fine] .  Bill finally comes, we've been here now for like an hour and a half, give them the restaurant.com certificate, and now the waitress has to find the manager to take it off.  ANOTHER 10 mins goes by, finally get the bill back, and thankfully we checked b/c they took the certificate off but then added 18% gratuity. OK. Our waitress was not worth 18%, I can guarantee you that, but fine.   What I didn't like was that she didn't mention that the tip was on there, which I HATE.  She was sat with a 10 to 15 top in the back, and 3 tables of 4.  THEN another table sat down of 6 men. They got the menu, waited a bit, no-one came to help them, they got up and LEFT--and I don't blame them.\\n\\nSo that was my story and my morale is: pick another steakhouse :) there's some really good ones in town.\",\n",
       " \"A big group of us went for dinner the other night, and we essentially got a tasting menu of sorts.  There were a few things that were only okay, but on the whole, everything was really really good. And yes, they do a trio of french fries to start.  I've noticed Michael Mina loves doing things in threes, and this place is no different.\\n\\nDuck Spring Rolls - tasty, but nothing to knock your socks off.\\nKobe Filet Tartare - very tender, very good. Some of the best tartare I've had\\nAhi Tuna and Hamachi Poppers - loved these.  Just little circles of crispy rice with a little bit of fish on top with some vinegar/soy sauce concoction \\n\\nI hope I'm attributing the reviews to the right meats, but was rather drunk by this point, so here goes:\\nFilet Mignon - very tender and flavorful, but maybe even a little over seasoned. \\nRibeye - Amazing.  Tender, flavorful, and not gussied up by a lot of seasoning.  \\nStrip - good, but definitely liked the other two better.  \\n\\nFor the sides, we had the Broccolini, Spinach, Mac & Cheese, and Potato Puree Trio.  All of them were good, but I especially liked the mac & cheese and horseradish potato.  \\n\\nAll in all, it came out to about $150 per person (including tip) with a bunch of wine. So yes, it is pretty expensive, but it definitely is some very good food.\",\n",

       " \"I really wanted to love this place. We stayed at THEhotel and I had a restaurant.com certificate for $50 off so I just had to try it. We didn't have reservations so sat at the bar to avoid a wait for a table and this may have been a mistake.\\n\\nThe duck fat fries are very very good and the fact that they are complementary makes them even better! I just wish they would have been hot or warmer.\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n\\nchicken with truffle mac n cheese\\nfilet\\n\\nThe chicken with truffle mac n cheese was so good, I loved the mac n cheese! Would highly recommend this dish.\\n\\nNow the reason for the 3 stars - the filet, it was cold and under seasoned. We've tried many different steakhouses and I don't think our standards are too high (we even love the steak at applebees!) but this was definitely not a $56 piece of meat. The quality was good but the way it was cook, was not. This is a steakhouse so the expectations for a good steak were a little higher.\\n\\nIf you are going here, definitely get the restaurant.com certificate and save yourself some $$$\",\n",
       " \"Not that this place was bad in any way, it was just very ordinary. The service was ordinary (we had a large group), the steak tasted as an aged steak should taste, the sides all had nice flavor. I just feel like there are lot of these steakhouses out there. Where is the risk? Where is that special thing that sets this place apart? If I'm going to go all the way out to Vegas for a steak, with all the options that are out there, all the huge names that opened a location to be part of the Vegas culinary experince I would want more than I got at Stripsteak.\",\n",
       " \"Two and a half years and another dozen visits since my initial review, StripSteak remains one of the top new American steakhouses in Vegas.\\n\\nFor starters, do not pass up the foie sliders.  This signature dish is topped with a tangy pineapple chutney and sweet onion jus that perfectly balance the richness of the foie.  Incredible.  The Kobe beef carpaccio, finished with south east Asian flavors is delicious.  Different from most, the coconut and Thai chili focuses the flavor of the raw beef and brings out its natural sweetness.  The duck confit spring rolls and Maine lobster fritters are also worth a try.\\n\\nSadly, A5 grades of beef are no longer offered.  The most flavorful of their current steaks is the American Kobe rib cap.  Sublime beef flavor.  Heady umame from the wood burning grill.  Great texture.  Add a side of roasted marrow bones and you're in beef heaven.   (I promise I don't eat liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti). \\n\\nNon-beef mains?  Who knows.  You don't go to a steakhouse to eat chicken or fish.\\n\\nDesert?  No room.\\n\\nThe wine list is outstanding, with a lot of gems from around the world.  Vegas resort pricing except for more expensive bottles where the markup is low.  \\n\\nVery Important:  The typical guest at this hip steakhouse has a lot of, how to put it,  disposable income.  The sommeliers try not to insult guest by asking how much they want to spend but rather make recommendations based on the caliber of the first bottle selected.  Save yourself the grief, Speak clearly and tell them what you want to spend.  Its not fun to be presented with an unexpected four figure wine tab.\\n\\nService remains excellent.\\n\\nHighly Recommended\",\n",

I decided to try the 18oz bone in  ribeye and my girlfriend had the 8 oz filet mignon (the special) it started with flavored duck fat french fries and several dipping sauces (instead of bread), which i was a big fan. fries do tend to harden up pretty fast, so they did tend to get a bit rubbery as the night went on. We then shared a wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon....very good and classic starter.  The steaks came out... mine ala cart and hers with a few sides ( the special) They were both cooked on the flaming grill which could be viewed from the dining room. the sides of truffled mac and cheese , the brussel sprouts with bacon and the spinach with..... you guessed it  .... bacon!!  were all good. Really though how can you go wrong with adding bacon??? the wait staff were very nice, and our waiter even gave us a few samples of wine to try before we made our decision ( I like that) \\n  On to the highlight!  My steak was a little more fatty than marbled, a little undercooked (which they fixed) and a little smaller than other 18oz ribeyes I have had ( the aging ??) anyway I could have had a bad piece as the filet was very tender and flavorful ( this was a great restaurant week deal) and the special even came with a mini creme brulee and 2 beignets. I must say that this is a 3/12 star place but I cant do that!  BTW we did stop by the first night for Happy Hour and I did have the Prime Rib sliders 2 for $10.00   they were excellent!  These sliders made me think of 4 stars rather than 3!!',\n",
       " 'My Mother-In-Law & I chose StripSteak for dinner one evening during our stay at Mandalay Bay. First of all, every restaurant in a hotel in Las Vegas is over priced, as expected. We decided we would have our splurge night here. Anyways...\\n\\nWe were able to be seated without a reservation, about 6:30. We ordered two glasses of Pinot Noir at $15 a piece. Our server told us we would be receiving a complimentary appetizer that evening. The appetizer were duck fat cooked french fries, done three ways. The fries were amazing, each seperately dished, seasoned and they each came with their own dipping sauce. Really tasty. Due to the pricing, my mother in law and I decided to share one of the larger steaks and order two seperate sides. I believe we ordered the 16 oz Kansas City Strip. $50+ for the one steak, a la carte. The steak was cooked to order, medium rare.\\n\\nNow, on to why I am rating three stars. I LOVE steak, cooked many different ways. The steak had a nice charred crust, which I love. But, it tasted like charred, burnt butter, which delivered a very unpleasant, bitter, chary taste which I was not expecting with a steak of this caliber. It was seriously unpleasant and I having to try hard to eat it all. \\n\\nOtherwise, we ordered the brussel sprouts which were AMAZING in their bacony, vinegary goodness. We also ordered baked Artichoke with goat cheese, which were also amazing, but personally, I would have ordered double brussel sprouts. \\n\\nOnto desert, I cannot personally recall the name of the dish, but I know it came with cocoa nib ice cream which was heavenly. \\n\\nOur service was excellent, and we had a very pleasureable dining experience. It can get a little loud, but the ambiance is excellent. \\n\\nSo 3 stars due to the over excessive pricing and the charred taste of the steaks. Otherwise, it was great!',\n",

Although the food offerings/specials for happy hour are few in number, all doubts will be cast away as soon as you get a whiff and taste of the food.\\n\\nThe bar and lounge food menu consists of a mere 5 items, and my friend and I decided on 3:\\n\\n1)  Prime Rib Sliders, $10; au jus with brioche bun\\n2)  Meatballs, $8; with heirloom tomato sauce and aged jack cheese\\n3)  Duck Spring Roll, $9; hot and sour cherry sauce\\n\\nWe ordered 1 item that was not listed on the menu, and that was the the trio of duck fat fries with herb, truffle, and bbq dipping sauces..\\n\\nAs far as drinks, select beers are $3, well drinks $6, and an assortment of \"featured cocktails\" are $6 as well.\\n\\nAside from the duck fat fries, our other favorite dish of the evening were the meatballs, as we thought the combination of the sauce and aged jack cheese certainly made a flavorful combination.  The prime rib sliders can be slightly on the messy side so make sure to have ample napkins available.  The spring rolls were delicious, but not as wonderful as the duck fat fries.  Truth be told, my friend and I ordered and devoured 2 orders of duck fat fries that night.....that dish is a winner!\\n\\nSERVICE:  Excellent and outstanding.

I had the $52 bone-in ribeye and it was an outback steakhouse equivalent at best (and I may be offending Outback).  It took a long time to receive and was barely warm when it got to the table.  We had to send two steaks back to be reheated.  It was 30% fat, thin, and just not good.  I rarely leave negative feedback but just had to relate our terrible, terrible experience.

I am not a vegetarian but I don\\'t eat steak very often.  This night I opted for the rib eye.  BEST STEAK ever!  I could only eat about 1/4 of it but every bite was amazing.  Two of my fellas got the same but my Son got the wagyu cut (this has replaced Kobe).  I was a little put off by the texture and appearance of this steak and did not try it.  My Son said the flavor was amazing and that he was glad he tried it but would probably never order it again because of the texture.  It was soft and gelatinous which was very unappealing to all of us.  We were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary amuse bouche of the duck-fat fries with dipping sauces.  There were plenty for all four of us.  There were three different types of fries and they were all unique and delicious; however, one of them was a little too salty for my palate.  The men thoroughly enjoyed them.  We ordered several of the sides with the stand-out being the truffle and macaroni and cheese.  The cocktail and beer selection was amazing as well.  It was a wonderful dining experience.   The server was knowledgeable and attentive.  She surprised us with complimentary \"kibble\" (out of this world, delicious, chocolate-covered gourmet popcorn) when she delivered our bill.  I ate one of the bags before we even left the restaurant.  ADDICTIVE!!  Be prepared to dig deep into your wallet though because this place is not inexpensive.  We felt it was worth every penny but this restaurant is not for someone on a budget.',\n",

I wasn't too concerned about this part too.\\n\\nWe started out with complimentary Duck Fat Fries that came with 3 different sauces.  They came out a little cold, but for being free they were enjoyable.  I'm not sure I would order them off the menu, unless they came out piping hot.  (I like my fried foods as hot as they can get).\\n\\nMy fiance ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the rib-eye.  They butter poach their steaks, which makes them juicy and delicious!  I enjoyed my rib-eye, but the filet mignon was superior by far.  We ordered wine with dinner, but I can't remember what we ordered.  \\n\\nAs far as sides, we ordered the creamed bacon spinach and potato puree 3 ways (one was with lobster, one with horseradish, and one was cheesy i think?).  The lobster mashed potatoes WERE SOOOO GOOD.  They were amazing.  I liked the bite of the horseradish ones, and the cheesy ones were also very good.  The creamed bacon spinach had a liquid smoke flavor, which I was indifferent about.  It was good, but I think I would try something else next time.  I'm just not a huge fan of artificial smoke flavor.  \\n\\nFiance ordered a cappuccino for dessert.  It was above average, good for a steak house.  \\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely like to come here again, but I'll be trying out other steak places before my return.

The management and host staff made sure that we were taken care of and sat promptly once the rest of my party arrived. \\n\\nOnce sat, the exceptional service from our waitress topped many dining experiences we have had here in Vegas (I am a local, and work in the industry). I had the Rib-eye charred med-r (restaurant lingo) and the wife had the scallop dish.  She loved the scallops, and my Rib-eye was perfect!

       " 'Very disappointing.  Ordered a vegetarian entree, my husband eats steak I don\\'t and all it was was a slice of romaine lettuce that was literally thrown on the grill, a runny hummus that didn\\'t even stick on the spoon, burnt pita bread, a tablespoon (literally) of Mac n cheese and some asparagus. The nerve of them to charge $30 for this. The mgr came over and asked what was wrong and i told him that the vegetarian entree prepared by the chef was disappointing to say the least and i showed him the hummus. He seemed shocked saying how people ask for the recipe of the hummus all the time. Not a very good response to someone who was clearly not happy with what was supposed to be an entree. It looked like the chef just threw together whatever he had laying around and called it an entree. Even more Strange since no where on the menu can you even order hummus so how would anyone even know that they make it to ask for the recipe? The appetizer we ordered originally was artichokes in a cream sauce but when it arrived it was nothing more than a greasy sloppy mess of a \"soup\" swimming in butter so we sent it back. Didn\\'t even bother to tell the mgr about that one because i really didn\\'t want to hear how that recipe is often requested as well. It was horrid. My husband had a steak and it was just ok. Nothing special about this place at all and in my opinion it\\'s just another overpriced restaurant in a strip hotel. Ive been to much better ones at other hotels. Craftsteak at the mgm for example was much better as was delmonicos in the venetian just to name a few.Also careful when ordering steak as they seem to have their own grading scale on med med well and well done with about six variations.

The Japanese ones are worth a try (you can cut the meat with your fork) because its better then what other steak houses offers.

Chapoutier 1997 it was heaven. Although I was getting full by this stage we continued with their New York Strip, bleu cheese scalloped potatoes, and the creamed corn. I am glad we split because I would have gone into a coma. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. Cooked to a medium and I was not ready to throw in the towel. \\n\\nBy the time dessert rolled around, I was about to die. The chocolate cake with spiced cherries was decent. It was a concentrated brick of decadence. I am not always a chocolate person, which made this too much for me. The strawberry pavlova was the highlight for me. The chef takes a classic dish normally eaten in Australia and New Zealand and puts his spin on it. I have tried this dessert a few times while traveling abroad and never liked it. It tends to be too sweet. Stripsteak's version was a more mellow presentation. Before presentation a strawberry jus is poured over the fresh fruit. The combination of that with the basil ice cream is magnificent. We had also got the beignets with a McCallan 18 caramel which I didn't care for.

I must say, the Filet was incredible!

If this wasn't a steakhouse, then I would order it again in a heartbeat.  It was bursting with flavor.  My husband ordered the skirtsteak and i took a bite of it, and savored the flavorful tenderness.  On a previous visit, he ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye and he claims that it was the best steak he has ever had.  On this particular visit, he wasn't very hungry, hence the smaller order.  Our friends ordered the ribeye and the filet mignon, and they enjoyed every bite.  They shared the truffle mac n cheese sides and the spinach souffle.  Everything was devoured.  In fact, we practically had to tear the truffle mac n cheese bowl away from our friend before he started licking it clean. \\n\\nI also did try the 3 types of complimentary duck fat fried french fries and the accompanying sauces.  The truffle dipping sauce was heavenly.  I am surprised that I was able to restrain myself the way I did.  \\n\\nThe food isn't the only thing calling my name... So is the House made ROCK N' RYE cocktail.  Holy sweet mother of Jesus! This drink is amazing. It consists of Wild Turkey Rye infused with Rock Candy, Citrus & Aromatics. The flavors are melded together for 30 days before it is poured over one giant ice cube.  This alone is a 5 star cocktail.  I can't wait to return and have a whole glass to myself.  Or maybe even two. \\n\\nReservations are a must! Be warned- it is quite loud at this restaurant.

We started with the complimentary duck fat fries. Each type had it\\'s own mouthwatering flavors, but my Dad\\'s favorite was the truffle, while mine was the Old Bay Seasoning with the herb sauce. YUM. \\n\\nWe also ordered the fresh oysters. We were given the choice of east or west coast, and we chose the smaller, sweeter Kusshi oysters from the west. They were perfect. The minuet sauce was fresh and paired with they perfectly. We then split a caesar salad. I loved their dressing and how it came with a anchovie on the side. \\n\\nOnto the STEAK. Which is why you really need to come here in the first place. Like I said, he ordered the Waygu Rib Cap, which if you read the other reviews is amazing. It\\'s rich and full of flavor. It\\'s Waygu, so expect it to be a little fatty (but a GOOD, full of FLAVOR fatty). I ordered the Filet, which was cooked just the way I like it. Both were medium rare. The rib cap had a nice charred crust on it which is another sign that it was cooked properly. \\n\\nTHE SIDES - oh the sides! We ordered the trio of potato puree. Horseradish, Lobster, and Sour Cream & Onion. My favorite was the horseradish becasue it think it pairs well with the meat. His favorite was the lobster with nice big chunks of loster in it. Basically to die for. We also had the creamed spinach which was another favorite. \\n\\nHonestly I can\\'t say a bad thing about this meal. We finnsihed off a bottle of wine between the two of us. Yes it\\'s expensive, but a nice steakhouse in Vegas SHOULD be expensive!

Also, they said that the rib eye on the pre-fixe menu is the same size as the regular order.\\nBefore the regular appetizers and entrées, they brought out 3 cups of French fries, each cooked differently (including one in duck fat) and each with a different dipping sauce (ketchup, aioli, and truffle oil).  I thought the fries cooked in the duck fat with the truffle oil sauce were great (10/10).  You just can\\'t go wrong with truffles.\\nI had the crab cake as an appetizer.  It was a lump crab cake, which is my favorite, as it had chunks of crab instead of shredded pieces.  It was very good (9/10).   It reminded me of Legal Sea Foods on the east coast.\\nI had the rib eye was my main dish and they did slightly overcook it.  It was supposed to be med-rare, but it came out closer to medium.

We ended up dining at STRIPSTEAK and Bouchon for our main dinners, and STRIPSTEAK took a notable second place for me out of those two experiences. The food is delicious and the service is great -- there's not a question there. I had the tuna and it was cooked to perfection. My fiancé had the bone-in ribeye and seemed to be in heaven. We split the bleu cheese scalloped potatoes as a side and started with the hamachi poppers, both of which were exceptional. Aside from that, we each had a couple of cocktails and noshed on their complimentary trio of fries (the truffle fries and aioli -- nom!). Still, we somehow managed to tally up quite the bill, which is where my uncertainty lies. Around $230 for the two of us. Again, no wine. Just a couple of cocktails each (sub-$15). We did have a restaurant.com gift certificate which helped, but we were still both a little surprised by the cost of the meal. It was good, but not so memorable where it was worth that investment (at least not in my book). \\n\\nThe ambiance wasn't totally what I expected either. I was expecting something a bit more Bouchon-esque (a little more closed off, dark wood, etc.), but instead the space was pretty modern and open. It's a place that you could go on a date just as easily as you could make it a guys night out. Not overly intimate in its surroundings, though still very nice.\\n\\nAll in all, I thought it was a very good meal. Not exceptional, and -- for me -- not worth the cost when there are so many other exceptional restaurants offering something bit more unique and equally delicious for the same price point. Still, I'm happy that I've checked a Michael Mina restaurant off the list. I just think I'd have been happier giving that money to Bobby Flay at Mesa Grill. :)\",\n",

I would go just for that!\\n\\nThe chicken breast was the perfect portion of white meat and pieces of crisp dark meat.  It came with truffle mac and cheese that was more delectable than it should have been.  A nice balance of cheese and truffle oil, but not too much truffle oil that it was over powering.\\n\\nTheir special was a pork chop with jalapeno creamed corn which was my FAVORITE part of my dinner.  It wasn't too spicy like I had anticipated.  The first bite is a kick but once you get to the sweetness of the corn, it extinguishes the fire of the jalapeno and becomes this perfect balance of sweet and spicy.\\n\\nThe potato puree trio was pretty darn good.  It came with 3 different potato purees: lobster, onion and sour cream, and horseradish.  They were a great compliment to our chicken.  it was like a creamy potato soup.  I really enjoyed the sour cream and onion.\\n\\nI give them an extra star for our wonderful waitress Lisa.  She was efficient, friendly and gave us a special treat at the end of our dinner.

Poor customer service can ruin your whole experience.  \\n\\nOur server somewhat forced me into getting the wagyu rib cap after I told him that I wanted the wagyu  ribeye and I didn't appreciate that.  While it was a good choice that I ended up getting rip cap our server was very aggressive.  I guess he was looking for a bigger tip.  \\nThe sides were just okay, we ordered the mac and cheese truffle and we had ordered the spinach soufflé and it came out undercooked, they took it back and brought it back to the table once we were all finished with our food.  \\n\\nOverall:  The restaurant was okay, the experience could have been better but the food was okay.

       " \"Pretty cool place. A bunch of stuff was closed at 430 when we ventured here. They have a happy hour menu, consisting of hummus, sliders, salmon poppers, spinach and artichoke brioche and salt and pepper fries. We got 1 of everything.  Hummus was fantastic. Very very tasty. I didn't eat the sliders, but my friend enjoyed. Salmi poppers were......weird. It was raw-ish salmon on top of fried rice cake with roe on top. I didn't really care for them too much. They weren't bad but wouldn't order again. The spinach and artichoke was tasty but very very pricey. The salt and pepper fries were WAY WAY too salty. All food items about are $7. They give 2 tiny brioche tarts with the spinach dip. 4 would have been better. Or at least 3. So, I'd definitely go back and get 2 hummus'. It was definitely my favorite. They have $6 margaritas and monitors. Also, some beer and wine is on the happy hour menu. Our bartender Chris was great. Friendly, quick to get our drinks, made them awesome and everything people ordered, he knew. True professional. Really enjoyed myself and will most likely return!!!!!\",\n",

The food and ambiance, however, were okay...nothing special. The steaks are gigantic so if you're going for portion size, this is the place to be. However, I felt like both our steaks were a little too charred and both had really large chunks of pepper scaterred throughout. We started with the crab cakes followed by the dry aged rib eye and the Kansas city strip, and then the root beer float and cookies for dessert. One of us got the pri-fix menu with the dry aged rib eye. I'd definitely recommend getting the pri-fix menu since you get an appetizer, a trio of sides, and a dessert. This is a special menu you have to ask for though...so they don't offer this deal upfront. The truffle mac and cheese and brussel sprouts were my favorite dishes of the evening.

However, my buddies assured perfection, and boy were they right!  First, let me start by saying that restaurants on the Strip are notorious for terrible service.  However, the service at Stripstreak was some of the best I've ever received.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and order the steak tartare for an appetizer.  Trust me.  For the main, most of the table ordered a filet instead of the larger steaks because we were heading to XS later, and let's face it - dancing while in a food coma is no fun.  The filet's came out perfect, and each had a nice char on the exterior while maintaining that familiar medium-rare reddish/pink interior.  The sides were equally impressive:  truffle mac and cheese, potatoes 3 way, duck fat fries, and creamed spinach.  So, if you're looking for a steakhouse in Vegas, Stripsteak will impress.  Don't be scared to dine on the Strip!\",\n",
       " \"Great steak places are a mix of not only excellent food, but excellent service to back.  Stripsteak meets those requirements, but does not differentiate itself from other steak houses enough to make the visit necessarily worth repeating.\\n\\nI settled in with two of my companions on a Sat night with no reservations (always a worry) but the service was able to snag us a corner table.  Perfect.\\n\\nThe restaurant started us off with some complimentary duck fat fries with three dipping sauces (in-house ketchup, old bay, and truffled aioli).  I've never been able to taste a significant difference in duck fat fries vs regular fries, and this was no different, but let me assure you, those fries were very tasty.\\n\\nAmerican Bone-in Ribeye - An excellent peace of beef, cooked perfectly to medium rare.  While the price was a bit high for the size IMHO, it had a nice sear on the outside and was juicy/flavorful throughout making it an enjoyable meal.  But true to my statement above, I've had great steaks before.  This is a great steak, but didn't stand out more than other great steaks I've had.  18oz bone in for $52.\\n\\nTruffled mac and cheese - Again, very tasty mac and cheese, and the truffled flavor was excellent.  A strong choice, but not anything that is phenomenal or mind-blowing to speak of.  \\n\\nPotato puree trio - Great concept: three types of flavored mashed potatos served side by side.  The lobster mashed had a few small chunks of lobster in it (so my companion told me, as I didn't get any lobster bites in the three spoonfuls I tried) and was interesting to taste.  The sour cream and onion was a pretty standard flavor, that probably could've used a slightly stronger seasoning as it tastes nearly plain compared to the other two.  The horseradish was easily the best tasting, and one of the standouts during dinner.  Something as simple as horseradish added to well made potato puree made it a really standout.  \\n\\nBeingets with vanilla creme brulee - Crisp on the outside giving way to soft pillow interior, the beingets were fried perfectly with a dusting of sugar.  And the vanilla creme brulee provided a perfect sugar crust on top to crak, and had a perfectly smooth creme inside that made every bite enjoyable.  This dessert had great execution, and was delicious.\\n\\nFinally, at the end of the meal, they provided two complimentary bags of peppered caramel popcorn to take home with us.  The popcorn was tasty, and the complimentary final note was a nice touch.  I enjoyed the popcorn about an hour later, and the texture had staled only sligthtly compared to freshly made, but it was a nice reminder of the meal we just had.\\n\\nVerdict:  A very solid steak restaurant and worth checking out.  They attempt to differentiate by using wood to grill (thus infusing the flavor of the wood into the meat) but to be honest, I can't taste a significant difference.  Service was top notch, food was top notch, and the overall experience was great.  Would I be back?  Possibly, to enjoy a good meal, but having had the opportunity to eat at a lot of great steak places, it's hard to warrant traveling to Vegas and coming by here again when there are so many other options of great food to try.

We were offered complimentary fries in 4 different flavors before our meal, which were both delicious and unique. Ordered the filet, asparagus and potato gratin side dishes. YUM. Before coming here, I thought I knew how I liked my steak and how it should be cooked....but StripSteak just blew that idea out of the water and set the new standard for me.

       " \"Strip steak is probably the most unique of the steak houses in Vegas. The focus is on the meat itself with very little outside influences. What that means is that the steak speaks for itself.\\n\\nThe ambiance is quite nice but since the bar is pretty big and at the entrance, the place is pretty loud too. The staff was very good in that they checked up on me often even when I didn't even order anything yet. They are the only ones that offered me a Prix Fix menu.\\n\\nThe first thing that comes out is probably one of the most addicting fries you will ever put in your mouth, their Duck Fat Fries. I know it doesn't sound as good but the crunch and flavor will change your mind. Knowing that is complimentary makes it harder to resist. It comes with 3 flavors: Original, Herb fries, and Old Bay fries (the latter being the saltiest and least favorite of the bunch for me). There are 3 dipping sauces, Truffle Aioli, Ketchup, and Mustard Remoulade (not sure how to spell that).\\n\\nThe appetizer was a single crab cake (normally $18). Although it seemed fresh and tasted very good, it was not worth the price in my opinion. Thank god for the Prix Fix menu. The one thing I will say is that as soon as it comes out, the fresh crab aroma does hit you pretty hard, which is good for seafood lovers.\\n\\nThe truffle Mac N' Cheese was very good. Not too cheesy, not too salty. The flavor is smokey so I wonder if they used some sort of smoked cheese like Smoked Gouda. Cream is smooth and not overpowering.\\n\\nThe Brussel Sprouts were undecipherable. It was a mish-mash of a whole bunch of stuff I could not discern. It reminded me of that Cafeteria mystery meat where you are unsure what is in it. Probably my least favorite side of all the steak houses I've been too so far.\\n\\nThe STEAK: The steak is first poached at 118-119 degrees in butter for 20-30 minutes, depending on size of cut. It is them placed on a grill raised by a giant wheel (as seen in pictures) over mesquite wood and charcoal. The seafood side of the grill has an additional wood (Olive Wood). Surprisingly, there is no char or crunch on the steak but because the steak was poached, the cooking is uniform throughout the steak. This is where Strip Steak focuses on the Steak. No other sauces are added.\\n\\nThe root beer float dessert brought back childhood memories. Nothing spectacular but great nostalgia.\",\n",

The server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  One of my favorite sides ever.  I am over creamed spinach!  We're through!\\n\\nWe went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  Forget bread, forget appetizers, you've got french fries!  I never make it to dessert anyways.        \\n\\nBut the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  We had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  The general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  She accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  I didn't make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another WHOLE porterhouse and box it up for us!  I was stunned.  Talk about going above and beyond!  Who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  Wow.  This was an all around great experience and I look forward to the next time.\",\n",
       " 'After having gone the week before, we were invited back. We shared the waygu burger. This was the top 3 burgers I have ever had! My husband totally agreed. We then shared the 30oz porterhouse with a side of onion rings. We asked if the chef could make a grilled vegetable plater for us to enjoy. They meet all our needs. Everything was wonderful. I was a little disappointed on the size of filet section of the steak for having been a 30oz porterhouse. The steak had great flavor.',\n",

We had been trying to eat here for months but every time we tried to book online through OpenTable it said they were booked. I called and easily got in at our desired time. The restaurant was not busy at all even though their online booking system said they were full. If we didn\\'t have the Restaurant.com coupon we would have probably given up on trying to get in. \\nWe had the filet Mignon/ medium rare- Spectacular and perfectly Medium rare.\\nPotato trio- get it even though you already ate the amazing fries.

And more specifically, only about their single malt Scotch selection. \\n\\nWOW. \\n\\nI asked for their single malt list, and they brought me .... A book!   Seriously. \\n\\nThis thick tome was organized by the regions of Scotland. Each section focused on a distillery with a small bit of history and trivia about the place, then listed the scotches, with tasting notes. I was able to try several that I never heard of. \\n\\nThey also offer a tasting flight with 4 scotches for $30 (as of March 2013). \\n\\nIf single malt is your pleasure - you have to check this place out.',\n",

It showed up charred black on the outside and raw and chewy on the inside. I had told the waiter that I wanted a steak that was not fatty. I guess I got \"up sold\"!  I Showed the waiter how raw it was so they took it back and finished cooking it while everyone else ate. Still charged full price. Towards the end of our $360, 2 adults and 2 kids meal we were still hungry so they brought out stale cold bread. We go to all the high end places in Vegas and this one is a SKIP !!!',\n",

Before I moved here, they remembered my name and all kinds of specifics after not seeing me for 6 months +.  The food is amazing in truly typical Michael Mina style.  Everything from the french fry  sampler to start, the truffle mac (my personal favorite) and the quality of the steaks...Im a happy man when Im here.  That is all',\n",

My wifes filet came to the table \"still mooing\" just as she likes it.         The mac and cheese was excellent and plentiful.  The scallion potato cakes weren\\'t quite as good as previous visits, but still above average.       We tried the lobster fritters on recommendation.  They were tasty, but  a bit overwhelmed by the bacon.  I dipped some of the house fries into the creme fraiche that came with the fritters and it was excellent.  They should consider offering that up as a regular option.  Overall, it was another excellent meal from Michael Mina.',\n",
       " \"I'm a bit ambivalent about Stripsteak.  On one hand, their Scotch selection was very extensive and, for the Strip, reasonably priced.  Yes, the Scotch menu is a big thick book, like a Scotch for Dummies because it gives a complete history of every single distiller and a thorough description of every single malt from that distiller.  And if the Scotch for Dummies bible isn't enough, the bartender Chris was wonderfully knowledgeable about the vast selection of single malts.  Unfortunately, the bar isn't really a great setup - not a lot of stools at the bars, and the tables for the bar area felt like they were almost in the middle of the walkway leading to the Event Center.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the restaurant is a very comfortable space, but the food is awfully pricey.  Very good, but not sure it's worth the cost.  Well, except for the delicious duck fat fries (served instead of bread), which were complimentary.  I had a foie gras appetizer that was one of the most delicious variations on foie gras I've ever had (not that I can remember ever having a bad foie gras dish), but it was $32.  The 90-day-aged sirloin steak was $72 - very good, but I've had better steak at lower prices.  The grilled asparagus was really good, just a tad too expensive at $14.  I ordered dessert, but can't remember what it was, just that it was really good too (and obviously not the least bit memorable).  Again, our server was also terrifically knowledgeable about the restaurant's impressive Scotch menu.\\n\\nSo the vast and reasonably-priced single malt menu is worth going back for, but the bar isn't a great space.  The dining room is very comfortable, but the food menu is priced just high enough that I don't see myself going back there to eat.  If Stripsteak had better bar seating or slightly lower food prices, I'd be a die-hard regular.  As it is, I'll probably be back every once in a while.  If you're a single malt guy, Stripsteak's Scotch menu is too good to resist.\",\n",
       " \"We were looking for some cold beverages after enjoying the Shark Aquarium and this place was boosting a pretty solid HH deal so we grabbed a seat where we could people watch (always great in Vegas) and had a few drinks.  I opted for my staple beverage, Cranberry and Vodka and my Mom some sort of Pineapple Rum combination that she enjoyed.  \\n\\nI believe HH was $4 for wells, it may have been $5, I can't remember now but either way this is a deal in Vegas for some solid drinks.\",\n",
       " \"I only rated this place one star and I honestly believe it  doesn't deserve that much. I really wanted to like this place! The experience was awful- we had dinner Sunday night and left hungry and disappointed. Duck fat fries were good. I ordered the scallops and they had no sear on them and were raw and cold in the middle. My husband ordered the filet medium rare and it was completely raw! This place is completely over-rated and over-priced. I don't mind paying for a wonderful meal, but I'm sorry, if you can't cook scallops- get out of the kitchen! We will never go back.\",\n",

It felt like a chore to try  maneuver the application. I'm 31 years old and my boyfriend is a web designer- we're pretty tech savvy, and found the app to be a pathetic piece of junk. \\n\\nTHE WAIT CONTINUES...\\nAfter we ordered our drinks it took at least 25 minutes for our server to come back to take our order. In the meantime we saw him dicking around and taking pictures with another table for at least a good 10 minutes. \\n\\nWhen our waiter, followed by the manager, finally came to our table we asked to order. We also inquired about the fries they serve at the tables, because we were starved after sitting there for about 45 minutes. The waiter said the kitchen was really backed up so it was out of his control, but the manager had no problem getting them for us, which wasn't surprising because all of the tables seated after us had already been served.\\n\\nTHE FOOD...\\nSix people ordered steak, four of which were the filet mignon, and no one was impressed. My boyfriend and I each ordered the salmon, which was okay, but definitely not worth the price or the wait. The side dishes were lukewarm, the vegetables were very oily, and we abandoned them half-eaten on the table.\\n\\nMy friends and I make it a point to have a few nice dinners whenever we all go to Vegas together. This used to be a staple on our trips, but it would take a lot of convincing to get me to go back after this alar visit.\\n\\nMediocre food and horrible service.\",\n",
       " \"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER?... This place is a joke. Ten of us went for dinner and ordered shortly after we got there. The food didn't arrive two hours later, the waiter was pompous and didn't care about us.  We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either. 10 very unhappy and hungry people walked out.  Funny thing was it was a Thursday and not busy....\",\n",
       " 'DO NOT WANT\\n\\nI can get an idea for what this place emphasizes and it\\'s not service.\\n\\nLet me list our problems with our visit to this establishment:\\n\\n1) Eternal waiting: our server took his time to make it to our table. The staff took their time delivering bread and drinks to us. \\n\\nOnce we ordered, it was at least 45 minutes, possibly longer, before our entrees were delivered to us. We discovered somehow that the kitchen chose to first serve a large group that arrived later than we did. No apologies, no visits from the manager, no \"make ups.\"\\n\\n2) Dishonesty: While waiting outside we had noticed the prix-fixe menu stated the rib eye was a 12-oz, while the rib eye a-la carte was 18-oz. That was reasonable for the price (which was roughly comparable); some in our party chose the a-la carte and others chose prix-fixe.\\n\\nWhen the entrees finally came, to our surprise there were no differences in the size of our steaks. When we inquired of the waiter he stated that the steaks were the same size regardless of prix-fixe or a-la carte. When we then pointed out that if we had known, all of us would have ordered the prix-fixe, he did not respond.\\n\\n3) Food: the best part of the meal, honestly, was the fries. The spinach souffle is nasty. And having been to Mastro\\'s, Ruths Chris, Lawry\\'s, and Flemings, the steak is overpriced for its quality. \\n\\nEasy to say we aren\\'t coming back and I hope this review drives foot traffic elsewhere.',\n",

Dining in first class restaurants on a frequent basis, I was less than impressed with the attitude I was given when I arrived for our reservation. I was informed that due to the fact that we were a bit late for our reservation that they set a time limit as to when we needed to leave. This is absurd, especially for a group of us that spent over $1,000 on food alone...not including the alcohol. The vibe of the restaurant is trendy, and if I weren't trying to speak with my friends on the opposite side of the table, I wouldn't have been bothered by the extreme noise level. I typically do not complain about service at a restaurant, especially in Vegas, but I felt compelled to share my experience in hopes that they improve their blahzay client service.

They could have been ordering drinks and appetizers, but instead, the table sat empty.  \\n\\nWe arrived and were told that we could eat, but that we would have to be out of our table by 9. Okay, that is fair, but how they treated us after that was not.  \\n\\nWe had plenty of time to eat, in fact we finished 20 minutes before 9. But we kept getting pushed...the waiter first said that he would choose out appetizers (because us reading the menu for 2 mins was too much) He kept reminding us that we were in a hurry. We rushed through our food and at 8:40 the waiter gave us dessert menus, threw some fiddle faddle packages, courtesy of the chef, on the table, and said that we could choose dessert and that we MIGHT have time to eat it.  Seriously guy? \\n\\nGratuity was included. We didn't give a penny more.  On the way out we commented to the hostess that they could have handled that situation way differently.  Understating that we had to be done by 9, they could have sped things up in the kitchen instead of constantly reminding us that we needed to rush. She argued with us instead of apologizing.  That is not customer service. \\n\\nEven more disappointing, we LOVE Michael Mina restaurants.  And planned ALL Michael Mina restaurants for our trip. This Michael Mina restaurant let us down :( But--American Fish (Aria) and Michael Mina (Bellagio) are both excellent!!!\",\n",

The experience I had was exceptional! They were very accommodating and the service was spectacular. My parents and I started the evening in the lounge for a couple of happy hour drink specials prior to our seating (we arrived early and prior to the opening of the main dining room). The happy hour drinks were well priced.\\n\\nOnce the main dining room opened, we were promptly seated by the hostess and our server was present to attend to us. He was exceptional with any questions that my parents had and dietary requests were received well and honored by the kitchen.The duck fat fries are a nice change to the regular bread and butter offerings of most restaurants.  We ordered a bottle of Joseph Phelps Opus One wine for our dinner and it was exceptional, but also costly... The wine list is exceptional for a steak house.\\n\\nWell all had appetizers of Salad. I always get the caesar salad (presentation changes every time) and the the Kansas City Striploin steak. My parents opted for a filet. All steaks cooked to perfection. We shared a couple of side dishes at the table and were also excellent.\\n\\nWe opted for a desert beverages as opposed to deserts. I opted for the Adult root bear float, which was likely kaluha and galliano with  a scoop of ice cream... Nice and refreshing.

Love, love, loved this bisque! \\n\\nI ordered the grilled diver scallops, which were delicious and reasonable. Four large scallops for under $40 is a pretty good deal, especially in Vegas. They are mesquite grilled and they were wonderful. \\n\\nI sampled everybody else's food, all of it was amazing!\\n\\nHalibut - Also mesquite grilled, light touch of lemon. Perfect.\\nKing Crab Legs - Served with drawn butter and lemon, and they removed the shells for my sister in law, very nice of them!\\nDry Aged Bone-In Ribeye - Only one person ordered steak at the steakhouse, lol, but it was one of the best ribeye's I have ever tasted. I would get that if I come again.\\nAmerican Wagyu Burger - Awesome burger with a really good mustard flavor to it.\\n\\nFor sides we shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with Peas, Potato Gratin with Gouda Sauce, and the Creamed Corn with Jalapeno. All amazing. The portions appeared to be pretty small, but they were actually perfect considering all the other food we had, we ended up leaving some of the sides behind.\\n\\nFor dessert with ordered the Beignets with the trio of sauces. We were given six light, airy, hot beignets with a very scotchy butterscotch sauce, a creme brulee sauce, and a chocolate pudding sauce. Mmmmm, I would come back to this restaurant just to get dessert again!\\n\\nDinner was $600 after tip, for five people, lots of cocktails, entrees, sides and dessert. Pricey, but about what to expect when you come to a nice steakhouse in Vegas. I hope to dine here again someday!\",\n",
       " \"Stopped by Michael Mina's StripSTEAK with a sales guy of mine about 2 weeks back. I was simply in the mood for a great steak, and just picked out one of the many steakhouses that I've yet to try in Vegas. It's located in the Mandalay Bay hotel, and the layout/ambiance goes for hip over comfortable. \\nApps: we went light with a couple of salads to start\\nEntrees: he got the filet, which he enjoyed. I ordered the Wagyu filet, with was completely underwhelming. It was just decent, and I was hoping for amazing.  On a night when I was in a big steak mood, it was a letdown. \\nSides: Mac n cheese was pretty awesome, and the sautéed spinach was good.\",\n",
       " 'When I think of the most disappointing meal in my life I think of Stripsteak. I was really excited to go. I gave it two stars instead of one because the foie gras sliders and the duck fat fries were good. \\n\\nThe steak was VERY greasy and not good at all you think paying $80 for a steak it would be amazing. But no. I would rather eat a steak at some chain restaurant. \\n\\nOur bill was $350 for 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 2 sides and 2 drinks and tip. Thankfully I had a $50 restaurant.com certificate. \\n\\nI would never go back and was very disappointed in the execution. Also the waitress was not attentive and she added an automatic 18% since I used the restaurant.com certificate which is tacky.',\n",
       " 'Four of us went to dinner here on a Friday night.  We were seated quickly and greeted by our waiter who left us the wine list and then did not return for at least 15 minutes.  We finally got up to ask for help and then our order was taken.  An hour later our first course was brought out and 30 minutes after that we received our main course.  So, in a place where our meal for four (with their 3 course special and a bottle of wine) cost $400 it took an hour and a half to eat.  The place was not full and we saw our waiter only about 4 times throughout that hour and a half.  We did complain to the manager who comped part of our meal, although she seemed to think the wait was not excessive.  The food was also not up to par for the cost.  Two people ordered the rib-eye and both were disappointed.  The other two ordered the filet mignon which was much better. I can only afford places this expensive occasionally, but I have been to several others at the same price point and quality/service was exceptional.  So, I would not return here.  There are many better places elsewhere to get good steaks for this price in Vegas.',\n",

       " \"This is a lovely steak house located in Mandalay Bay with great decor, excellent service, and a classy ambiance.  So why 2 stars?  Quite frankly, our steaks were incorrectly prepared.\\n\\nFirst some background: I make a middling 5 figure salary, so I can't afford to eat $60 steaks very often.  But when I do, it's usually worth every penny.  I've happily dropped $300 on a single meal because it's difficult to find world-class beef that is expertly aged and prepared.\\n\\nI ordered the ribeye medium and my fiancee had the filet mignon medium-well (each is currently $59), we had the spicy zucchini and asparagus sides, and we ordered two glasses of Michael Mina's cabernet.  When our steaks arrived, I was bitterly disappointed to find that my ribeye was overcooked, somewhere between medium-well and well-done (no trace of pink whatsoever), while my fiancee's filet was completely well-done.  \\n\\nOur vegetable sides were about quantity over quality: I'm not sure how many fistfuls of zucchini and asparagus is customary for two people, but the zucchini was hardly spicy and the asparagus was elementary.  I'm certain I could've made either side at home blindfolded.\\n\\nAll the work that goes into designing and executing such a beautiful restaurant flies out the window the instant the chef overcooks your steak.  When the apex of your evening on the town is your dinner, and the keystone of your dinner is your incorrectly prepared steak, it puts a damper on your mood.  I am not one to send back food, mostly because it irreparably throws off the timing of the meal, but when I mentioned to our server the problem with our steaks, she informed us that lately customers had been complaining that their steaks were undercooked.  She had received authorization from the manager to give us complimentary desserts, but we declined.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that the quality of the beef was superb, and the pacing of the meal was comfortable.  We were treated very well, and the wine was satisfying.  This review is not about the price nor the value for your money.  It is simply about two overcooked steaks and two underwhelming sides.  At this level, there is no room for error.\",\n",

The best one of of the three was the sour cream and onion then the horseradish and last was lobster.

But overall, this trio was nice and creamy. 4/5\\n\\nBeignets:\\n6 beignets. We got the trio of sauces: Macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding, vanilla creme brulee and chocolate pot de creme. I wasn\\'t sure why they called it \"sauces\" since the creme brulee and pot de creme were oh-so thick to be dipping sauces. The only sauce I used to dip the beignets in was the butterscotch pudding which really tasted like alcohol. I had to eat the creme brulee and pot de creme as individual desserts.

There were a number of items including baked potatoes that were not available this evening. This had to be a major faux pas on the part of the order department but totally affected our view of the place. They must have used up all their potatoes making French fries because that was what they bring in lieu of bread. Their special this evening was prime rib encrusted with a horseradish mix. This my wife ordered the special and it was way below par perhaps being the worst prime rib she has ever had. Nothing to do with the mix, the food was bland and hard to eat. The steak I had was good though. We had Brussels sprouts, which were sliced and blended with bacon, which was tasty. The potato scarcity coupled with the tasteless prime rib assured that we would not be back to this restaurant. A steakhouse with out baked potatoes is just not right. I say dressy in how one should show up but that usually does not happen anymore. Some of our fellow diners were dressed up while others were in sandals and shorts. The short of it is this is a restaurant in a resort and really does not have to live up to any expectations. The management definitely is aware of this fact.

It was a nice touch since we didn't order an appetizer. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\n\\n30oz Porterhouse: It was a good size and since I'm not much of a meat person, my husband had to take care of the majority of it. The meat was perfectly cooked albeit a bit under-seasoned. \\n\\nPotato puree trio: Such a cute presentation and a perfect side for spud lovers. The potatoes were pureed to creamy perfection but the flavors weren't very potent. The lobster mash wasn't as decadent  as Mastros, and the sour cream and onion tasted like plain mashed potatoes. The horseradish had a nice kick to it and was my favorite of the bunch.\\n\\nBrussel sprouts: We read it had bacon lardon mixed in and we were sold. The smoky flavor of the bacon complemented the shredded brussel sprouts nicely. \\n\\nWe also ordered a bottle of Cabernet and it was our first time seeing the sommelier pour a little bit out  to taste for himself before presenting it to us. \\n\\nThe server was attentive but not intrusive.

       " 'My husband and I had dinner here with another couple and it was fabulous!  We started with cocktails at the bar, and were really pleased with the variety and creativity of drinks offered.  Definitely a great spot to come back to before a show.\\n\\nAfter being seated by the friendly hostess we were greeted with a complimentary french fry trio (YUM!!!!!), and then started off with the Oysters.  They were delicious.  Just briny enough to please any palate, and the cocktail sauce had an awesome kick to it.  The sommelier was helpful in choosing a wine, and I definitely recommend asking him for a recommendation based on what you are eating.  Following the appetizer we had salads, which were crisp and beautifully presented.  Ordering one to split among two people is more than enough, and they are happy to divide the salad between two plates for you (always a nice touch).\\n\\nFor entrees two people in our party had steaks (filet and ribeye, I believe), and two had seafood entrees.  The meat-eaters said that the steaks were some of the best they had ever had, and the seafood dishes were cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.  For sides we had one order of truffle mac and cheese to share, and it was plenty for four people.  The entrees also come with a small garnish of potato and carrot, so everyone was definitely full by the end of the meal.  \\n\\nOverall we will definitely be visiting Stripsteak again!  The waiter was excellent, and the service was highly attentive - just what you come to expect from a high end steakhouse in Vegas.  Cheers!',\n",
       " \"We come to Vegas at least once a year and we always make time to have a meal at StripSteak.

       " \"My husband and I went here for Restaurant Week last August. The pluses are that the customer service was very good and they gave us complimentary appetizers (trio of fries with 3 sauces). However, being that it is a steak house, the steak was just not very good. It was chewy and something I would not want to eat again. So I won't be going back to STRIPSTEAK. Also, it is very expensive if you go when it is not RW.\",\n",
       " \"The wife and I met a friend of mine for dinner at Stripsteak on a Monday night.  We were very familiar with Michael Mina's steakhouse concept having enjoyed his Bourbon Steak, one of our favorite places in DC, on multiple occasions.  As a result, we had high expectations for Stripsteak.  Stripsteak occupies an open, modern-looking, high-ceilinged, well-lit space along Restaurant Row in Mandalay Bay.  Since we had early reservations at 6pm, the dining room was virtually empty except for us.  Given that we practically had the place to ourselves, the service was solid and our food came out expeditiously, hot and fresh throughout our meal.\\n\\nOur meal started out with Mina's signature amuse of Duck Fat Fries with a trio of dipping sauces.  The fries were hot and crispy.  They were a nice prelude to our meal, but still...just fries.  Stripsteak's strength is in its wood-fire grilled proteins.  I had the 8 oz. American Wagyu Rib Cap, medium rare.  My rib cap came out cooked precisely to my requested doneness, seasoned with restraint with only salt and pepper, was fork tender, and was, not unexpectedly, wonderfully juicy and flavorful.  It was the perfect treatment of this treasured cut of meat.  We shared orders of the Roasted Wild Mushrooms and Mac & Cheese with black truffle sides.  The mushrooms, a mix of maitake, oyster, and possibly another variety, were earthy, tender, and possessed subtle smoky notes from the wood-fire roasting.  The mac & cheese possessed distinct but balanced truffle flavor.  It was a solid and enjoyable upscale rendition of a comfort food staple.\\n\\nStripsteak served up an excellent meal that lived up to our expectations.  As steak joints go, it held its own with Las Vegas' best steakhouses.  It's not for the budget-conscious, but thankfully on this evening, my buddy picked up the tab.  4.5 stars!\",\n",
       " \"Expected more from this steakhouse.  Our waitress was very nice but service was so slow.  It felt like an eternity waiting for our main course.  Also, the restaurant is pretty noisy with loud music coming from next door.  \\nAmerica's oysters and the sea bass dish were good.  My 8 Oz. Wagyu filet was decent.  Our check came out to $180.  Should have paid a little more for Craftsteak.\",\n",
       " \"The salad was great but from there it went down hill. Service wasn't very good and we went at 6 pm. They charge for refill on soda, really $60 steak and have to pay for refill. Steak had a bad taste to it. Semi warm.\",\n",
       " \"Amazing. Amazing Amazning. \\n\\nI have been here 3 times and each time has been stellar! I have had the filet, the sea bass and the flank steak and all were just delicious. The wood fired grill really gives the steaks a unique flavor. The mushrooms....just to die for.\\n\\nThe best and most amazing part (if you ask me) are the frits you get (for free) as starters. They all have individual dips too. Nom nom. \\n\\nThe service is impeccable as well. I have a background as a waitress, so I always like to see how the waiters take orders, etc. I don't get to say this too often, but they were on point. \\n\\nThe martinis are made to perfection.

It's a very little thing, but offering complimentary duck fat fries is fun and I appreciate something different. It was one of the selling points in addition to Michael Mina that attracted me here. \\n\\nLet's start with the good. The Wagyu rib cap was amazing and super tender. I'd recommend this steak hands down to anyone that dines here. The lobster fritters and wagyu satay appetizers were tasty too. They come in a set of three, which is kind of odd but maybe it goes with their theme along with the three types of fries and three dipping sauces that came with them. The Loup de Mer, which is an european seabass (skin attached), was worth ordering as well.\\n\\nThe not so good. I kind of wish the fries came in a more timely matter. If they came before we finished ordering, that would've been more appropriate. There were just too many different servers for our table and it just felt out of place. They had someone walking around with fries, then another person take our order, then another person who cleared our plates after the appetizers, then one of them came back to set up our table for dessert. Also, the timing of when all the food came out was out of sorts. The fries came a while after we ordered, but then it took even longer to get the appetizers out. I understand steak restaurants take a long time to get it right, but it felt inordinately long for the entrees even when the server said it was coming anytime now. I also could've went without the potato puree and spicy zuchinni side dishes, just didn't seem to put much effort here. The cuts of the zuchinni were amateurish imo. \\n\\nI would be extremely happy to come here for a cup of water and their wagyu steak.\",\n",

My wife was satisfied with the glass of Cab she selected off of the (iPad!) wine list, which was fairly robust. \\n\\nThe Rib Eye was very tasty and served at a proper temperature, and the foi gras was delectable. The sides were just okay, and I wouldn't recommend the mac and cheese, which was watery. \\n\\nI would recommend the service which was attentive and knowledgable.

We both never had dry aged steak before but after this experience, we will not have our steaks any other way.  They were well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I just wish they offered their signature 75 day dry aged tomahawk steak.  I guess it's another chance for me to go back.\",\n",
       " \"We were pretty disappointed with almost everything at this restaurant. It was pretty noisy and my husband and I were sat at a table where we had to sit across from each other. We could barely hear each other due to the noise. Our server was nice, the problem was that the service itself sucked. Everything took forever!! I ordered a cocktail which didn't even arrive until after our appetizer. When my steak came out it wasn't just rare... It was raw and I had ordered it medium. My husband had also ordered the same steak prepared the same way and was done eating before my steak came back out. Even after being cooked longer it still came out hardly even warm. The best part of the whole meal was the cheesecake. So I'd have to say the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is the cheesecake and the nice server.\",\n",
       " 'Got the bone-in ribeye.  Nicely seasoned, however my steak had way too much fat compared to other bone-in ribeyes.  Free duck fries is always good!  The mushroom side dish was excellent.  Came here for an early Saturday dinner with no reservation and was seated right away.',\n",
       " 'To give you an impression of how good this \"steak\" restaurant is...I ordered the pork.  I was here with a couple of buddies and we were all hopeful for a spectacular meal. \\nMind you the food wasn\\'t horrible, but the experience of a steak house was completely null and void. If I wanted food court atmosphere and noise, I would have opted for the McDonald\\'s McRib and saved myself $130.  \\nAdditionally, when I sit down at a famous chefs restaurant, make sure I don\\'t have the capability to make better side dishes or steaks (from what I gather none of the guys who had steak enjoyed it) at home. And for the prices that are charged, offering me a \\'french fry\\' sampler \\'compliments of the house\\' was pretty tacky...don\\'t give ketchup a fancy name in the hopes I\\'d never had ketchup before and didn\\'t know what it tasted like. \\nOh, and pay no attention to the dress code because the staff doesn\\'t.

       " 'I have been to as many Michael Mina steak restaurants as possible after falling in love with Bourbon Steak in DC. I mean they give you French fries instead of bread- what\\'s not to like? That being said I would say my experience at the Vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in DC or SF but I am a Niles Crane-esque nitpicker so don\\'t let that deter you. Also, Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the Border Grill brunch). There are like 3 negative reviews where the people say \" I can make food better than this\"- I\\'m not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. \\n\\n\\nThe Steak\\n\\nI always get a bone in ribeye when I first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. The ribeye here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and I actually think the meat was a little tastier. The steak had been trimmed a little more than I would like (fat= flavor) but it didn\\'t seem to have negatively affected the steak. The curst was nice and salty- good. Medium rare was a deep red-good. The price (59$) is pretty average for Vegas steak joints on the strip. My dining companion got the Waygu  vs Waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what I will get the next time I go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) \\n\\nThe Sides\\n\\nSome people, after eating 2 lbs of French fries, might think \"You know what; I probably don\\'t need another potato side\". We call those people losers. The reason these underhumans won\\'t be dining with me is because Stripsteak has a little something called the Potato Puree Trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. Perhaps I am a philistine but the lobster potatoes were actually freaking awesome. I know it probably shouldn\\'t be done, I know it\\'s probably not the choicest lobster bits but jesus... it is good. \\n\\nThe mac and cheese- I also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. It was quite \"crusty\" with lots of bits on top which I like. The mac itself was perhaps a little dry but I would rather that than have it swimming. \\n\\nBroccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good.',\n",

We had to wait an hour for our table and when we got there, we ordered an array of stuff. I dug the truffle fries and their sides are good (particularly the gratin potatoes).

You can do better, and you should.\",\n",

The bartender, Anthony, was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is somewhat casual for such an expensive restaurant (there are TVs in the bar area), but it was contemporary and comfortable. \\n\\nInstead of serving bread, they serve a sampler of three different types of fries (cooked in duck fat) with three different sauces. I can\\'t remember what they all were, but I liked them all. We thought it was both odd and interesting to have fries instead of bread, but we enjoyed them. \\n\\nThe only disappointment of the evening was the wedge salad. We asked to have it chopped and split--and when it arrived it looked like two $2.50 side salads from Denny\\'s. Seriously, an upscale restaurant like this should have a fancy wedge, with high-priced blue cheese crumbles, ample house-made dressing, and loads of freshly cooked bacon. Instead we received a small bit of iceberg lettuce with hardly any dressing or cheese crumbles and what my husband called \"bacon dust.\" You couldn\\'t taste the bacon at all. (They should check out the wedge at Mastro\\'s to see what an upscale wedge is like.) I think this wedge was around $16--maybe more.  Crazy!\\n\\nAnyway, things got much better when our entrées arrived. I ordered the yellow tail sashimi appetizer, and it was some of the most delicious sashimi I\\'ve ever had. It was super fresh and tender--practically melted in my mouth--and it was prepared just perfectly, with just a touch of sauce and jalapeño; it had a perfect balance of flavors.  \\n\\nMy husband ordered the filet, and it was cooked perfectly--very tender and flavorful. \\n\\nWe also shared the potatoes gratin. It was like a large brick of thinly sliced, tender potatoes in a cheesy cream sauce (no unwanted ingredients, such as onions). They were delicious. \\n\\nFinally, we had to have dessert. I thought the beignets with three different sauces sounded delicious, but Anthony recommended the apple crumble (served with vanilla bean ice cream), so we ordered that instead. Anthony was right--it was great. He also brought out one freshly cooked beignet for us to try (so nice of him!), and it was delicious too. \\n\\nWe left Stripsteak fat and happy. Highly recommend!

I notified the waitress to tell her manager so they could check it after closing before it got bad. She offered to move our table which we declined because it was so small it was no biggy, we just wanted to make sure they checked it before it became a problem.

Eventually moved to a table in the front dining room for a breath of fresh air mid-way into a main course where veal was presented instead of the pork that I\\'d ordered it was at last in the finale that STRIPSTEAK would prove most impressive with a trio of world class desserts followed by the restaurant\\'s signature beignets but with both managers avoiding our table as the $500 tab for Chef Gerald Chin\\'s uneven cooking arrived I could only shake my head wondering when Chef Mina last stopped by Mandalay Bay, a stunning departure from memorable experiences at Bourbon Steak, Wit and Wisdom, American Fish, or Arcadia.',\n",

(no problem) 10 mins goes by and nobody is yet to stop by our table. Finally the same host saw that we hadn\\'t been helped. So he brings up a dinner and drink menu.

I had to ask that server for the Fries that come on the house because our server never came back or brought them. I ordered the 16oz NY Strip and my wife ordered the Filet Mignon.

It came with a coconut-red curry and sunchoke puree that didn\\'t do much for the halibut. It needed salt. The curry overpowers the sunchoke so that you don\\'t really taste much except a light hint of coconut milk.  \\n\\nThe aforementioned sides and dessert of bourbon infused custard saved the meal.

I ordered the $40.00 salmon...I call it \"the $40.00 salmon\" because the only thing that stood out about it was it\\'s price. I had to send it back. It was chalk dry and overcooked. It was disgusting. My boyfriend said I make way better salmon at home. We went to Norm\\'s the following day, even Norm\\'s makes better salmon. Like way better. Then they made me a new one and it was rare. I knew they simply don\\'t know how to cook, no matter how many times I send it back, it\\'s still going to suck and I like sashimi so I ate it. \\n\\nMy boyfriend\\'s steak was, \"alright,\" (his words, verbatim). Our bill came out to $153.00.  We left the waitress, who spent most of the night gossiping with the other waitresses, 15%. Save your money. This restaurant blows.',\n",
       " \"One of the best steakhouses in Vegas. They start the meal with complimentary fries made in duck fat with three dipping sauces, a nice change from the bread course. We then had Instant bacon and a dozen oysters. The bacon was great.  Bacon is a hot dish right now at steakhouses and there's was among the best if not the best. Oysters were good but I hate when there is any she'll and every oyster had a little bit of shell. \\n\\nThe steak shined. I had the Wagyu rib cap and it was incredible. I had it once at Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse, which was excellent but this was transcendent. I almost did not order because at Mina's SF steak house, Bourbon, it was VERY mediocre. Again, one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had.\\n\\nSides were great. Everyone, myself included loved the Russell sprouts but I personally enjoyed the truffle Mac cheese the most. It had a full truffle flavor that stood up to the whole meal.\\n\\nNormally, I avoid the desserts but because everything was so good and they did not disappoint. The cheese cake had a lime filling that was incredible and the tartness worked very well. We tried a couple other desserts, which were also perfect, but I forgot exactly which ones. \\n\\nOverall, a fantastic evening.\",\n",
       " \"Our party of five ordered 3 New York steaks and 2 bone-in ribeyes.\\n\\n4 out of the 5 steaks we thought were not hot enough.  Part of the issue is they don't use hot plates.  My ribeye was well-seasoned (I think) but it's hard to tell when it is just warm and not hot.  It's hard to eat a fatty medium rare piece of meat when it is closer to room temperature.  Cold fat is not good.\\n\\nDuck fat fries were pretty good.\\n\\nService was just average.  Nothing bad.  But didn't go out of the way to provide exceptional service.\\n\\nSides that were good:  broccolini, potato gratin\\nSides were just okay:  brussels sprouts, bone marrow (not enough bone marrow)\\n\\nI'm not sure I'd come back until they fix the issue with the temperature of the steaks.\\n\\nWe thought that's how they serve it at Stripsteak because it looked like other patrons' steaks looked the same (not piping hot).\\n\\nIf they fixed the temperature issue, solid 4 stars.\",\n",
       " \"Disappointing. I expected more from this place, especially considering all the raving reviews and the fact that Michael Mina owns this place. The complimentary fries were pretty good. Basically, the fries were provided in three stainless steel cups, with each cup filled with different flavored fries: parmesan, truffle, and duck fat. I also tried the West/East coast oysters. Those were too fishy for me...maybe the flights that shipped those oysters were delayed. My party ordered a few appetizers of which was the bone marrow. The marrow was topped with an overwhelming amount of onions. The richness of the marrow disappeared, as a result. \\n\\nNow onto the main event. I had the NY Strip cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, but served warm. Tasted similar to meat cooked an hour ago which sat under a warming lamp; similar to a buffet. Don't get me wrong, the meat tasted dry aged, but the temperature of the meat threw me off. \\n\\nService was generally okay, except when my party asked for another set of complimentary fries, we got rejected and was told..$6 please. I expected more from a place that sells $50-75 steaks. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place because of the brand and reputation, but unfortunately...I've experienced better.\",\n",

We shared the Lobster Fritters with Meyer lemon creme fraiche...I wanted to spoon out the creme fraiche but we (my husband and I) were sharing with another couple. The filet I had was the best steak I have ever eaten. It sliced like butter. We shared the potatoes au gratin and the Mac and cheese (plenty to share with four people).

I went with the Renteria as I only wanted a glass and not a bottle, and it paired excellently with my dish.  For the naysayers of this place you obviously think Outback is top shelf meat.

Waited 30 minutes after the reserved time then waited 20 minutes to order plus another hour for waiting for our entrees. Spent $110 on porterhouse and it was dry, overcooked & flavorless.  Some steaks were missing standard baby carrots and bulb onions on the plate.  The steak- the $110 porterhouse was lukewarm and felt like it's been sitting under the warmer.\\n\\nThe service was another story. My friends felt like he wasn't friendly or attentive enough considering we do expect steakhouse service.  However, I did feel like he was friendly inside but just not with a smile on his face. It felt like he didn't want to serve us.  When I mentioned to him about my disappointing porterhouse, he did comp my dessert which was a nice touch but still couldn't make it for the whole experience.   Sad but yeah, stick with BLT or joes stone crab you'll be much more satisfied when you walk out that door.\",\n",

I've only ever had amazing cuts of steak here. There is a special procedure they use to cook it that they are very willing to explain. They are gluten-free friendly and knowledgable, they make everything from scratch so if an item does include a glutenous ingredient they can make it without it. My favorite part about this place is the complimentary duck fat fries in lieu of bread. You get three different kinds with three different sauces, and they are amazing! I like the atmosphere and it was quiet enough to have a conversation (when you are not eating the delicious foods of course!). Timing of service is great and they are accommodating if you have somewhere to be by a certain time (a show, etc). This restaurant is at the top of my must-go list when visiting Las Vegas!\",\n",

I requested medium, but after it arrived, they had cooked it completely to a well done. The seasoning was not good, and overall it didn't taste like a steak priced at around $100. As for the size, half of it was bone, so we really got maybe 5-7 oz each. Left there hungry... Will not recommend.\",\n",

The expectation is that the kitchen of an establishment like this should get it right the first time and would  be able to re-fire a steak correctly the second time; no such luck.  \\n\\nNow to the management reply... it took forever to get the manager to the table and when she did arrive there was little to no remorse about the cooking errors, and I mean NOTHING. A lopsided apology at best.\\n\\nI guess the restaurant feels that with such a transient clientele as a Las Vegas resort has they do not need to extend themselves to diners to make a bad experience right or the food right because most people don\\'t return visit for approximately a year and most are too lazy to write reviews.  BTW, I am writing this in December and my experience was in June;  I got busy, but I didn\\'t forget!\\n\\nThink twice about a reservation... there are sooooo many wonderful steakhouses in Las Vegas,  even if you have to get in a cab.',\n",

For someone who loves french fries, that means the world to me lol. I would have been happy with just that, but I was here to eat steak :)\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of small plates to start, including the instant bacon (which looks nothing like bacon and a lot like pork belly with a fried oyster on top), bacon-wrapped lobster fritters (freaking amazing), wagyu filet tartare, and froie gras dumplings. They were quite small so yes, there was still room for steak and desserts :) \\n\\nWe split the bone-in rib eye, medium rare. It didn't need any sauce but we ordered the trio of sauces to try. It was tender and juicy and wonderful! \\n\\nThe couple we were dining with didn't have room for dessert since they had to finish their wine (and ours) so we split the maple custard.

She was friendly and responsive when we did see her, so I\\'m sure it was just a tough night.\\n\\nThe hostesses were less pleasant, mumbling responses and then practically ignoring us.  If we hadn\\'t had reservations for dinner and tickets to a show right after, I would have gone somewhere else right then.\\n\\nNow let\\'s get to the great part - the food!  We both had steaks, one a filet and the other a ribeye, both of which were expertly cooked to order.

I was definitely impressed with those portion sizes.\\n\\nCocktails were nothing special, tho the Scottish stout beer my other half enjoyed was the best he\\'s had.  The dessert menu looked nice, but nothing really jumped out at us.\\n\\nOverall, it was a nice experience.

The manager mentioned that they would be updating the website, after 2 years, to correct that they had happy hour specials... Meanwhile, our entire (now very hungry) party had to  to finish our drinks and find  a different restaurant .   Really,  the proper,  or classy move by the manager would have been to offer us the advertised happy hour menu and prices to make up for the mistake.

Yep, those days and deals did exist. Even 5 start hotel rooms could be had for $100 a night. The casinos made their money from the gamblers, so they wanted to attract everyone with great prices on room and board.

Note that I have an issue with Wagyu meat... it costs much more than \"grass fed\" equivalent, but I can\\'t really tell the difference. Although the price at Strip Steak was not bad ($65 for a 12oz Wagyu Skirt Steak, the one that broke all records was the Wagyu filet at Nobu in NY for $25 per Oz.. that is insane, unless it had a secret side effect like growing hair or curing ED).\\n\\nBut high end places in Vegas are now like Strip Steak... good to great food and service, but prices that require a credit from the casino cashier manager in order to cover the \"experience\". We were two guys, one Wagyu steak each, one side each, one bottle of wine and two deserts... $300 with tip... wow. Good thing we were on expense account, and now I have a week to come up with an excuse when the secretary questions the expense... like \"Elvis just left the building...\".\\n\\nIn summary: if you landed in your private jet and took the Bentley with the scantly dressed Victoria Secret\\'s model as a chauffeur, then I\\'m sure you will thoroughly enjoy the food and service of Strip Steak. If you are a commoner (like me) I suggest you put it on your boss\\' credit card. If both scenarios are not doable, then head to downtown Vegas, they also have great places for a fraction of the cost.\\n\\nBut don\\'t take me wrong: I loved the food and the service (by the way, our waitress was beautiful, sexy and very efficient.. kudos!), but I had to knock off one star due to the high price... it just doesn\\'t make sense...sorry.\\n\\nCheers!',\n",

The potatoes were AWESOME! Highly recommended. I also had the San Francisco Mule, which was also fantastic. Prices are not cheap, but totally worth it!',\n",

       " \"So my wife and I finally ate here after passing it so many times walking through the Mandalay bay, and I'm disappointed. \\nThe food was pretty weak, I don't know if it was just off or if it's the way that it is here. I won't be back to do it again. \\nFor appetizer we had the tuna crisp things and the foie gras. Both were pretty plain, and didn't actually do a whole lot for either of us. Matter of fact both were kind of a waste of time. \\nMy wife had the wagyu filet, and I had the wagyu rib cap. So to basically describe the flavor perfectly...I had to ask for salt. I have never had to ask for salt at a steak place. There was no flavor. It was literally flavorless. The only flavor was that slight burnt oil flavor that occurs just when the oil/butter starts to blacken and turn a little greasy. It wasn't greasy, but it did have a hint of that flavor. \\nThe service was friendly and efficient. The fries that they serve were awesome. The restaurant itself looks nice on the inside. The food was bs. I left and got some dessert at Fleur. I couldn't take a chance on anything else there.\",\n",
       " \"We made reservations for 8 on Friday afternoon for a 7:15 dinner. We were greeted and seated promptly at a round table which was perfect for our conversations.  \\nThe complimentary french fries were a hit, especially the Old Bay seasoned fries.  Everyone in our party we're completely satisfied with their meals, from the kale salad to their steak and fish entrees.  The service was good but our waiter was not very personable.  I felt as if he was tired of being at work.  However he did get us our food promptly and to our 9:30 show on time. \\nIn short, I had ordered the Kurobuta pork chop and thought I might regret a few minutes after placing my order.  After my first bite I was glad I strayed off the normal filet dinner.  This chop was the biggest I had ever seen.  It stood about 2 inches high and was seasoned perfectly.  I was worried the thickness would not allow it to be cooked thoroughly but there was no pink to be found.  The mushroom risotto and pork jus accompanied the chop very well.\\nFortunately my wife ordered the CAB filet, had it butterflied to ensure it was cooked to medium plus and it did not disappoint.  The potato gratin was incredible and the broccolini had the perfect amount of citrus added to it.\\nWe had to catch the 9:30 Michael Jackson One show and did not have time to order a dessert but fortunately we all were provided with popcorn drizzled in chocolate which was a sweet way to end our meal.  We will definitely be back.  Michael Mina has not let us down yet.\",\n",

Took them off and it tasted much better. \\n\\nThe chef also brought over a plate of three sets of fries with dipping sauces.  One was truffled, one with sea salt, and one with fried in ducked fat.

       " 'Very solid option for a steak dinner on the strip.  My wife and I had the New York Strip and the Bone-In Ribeye, respectively, and they were both very good steaks.  However, my medium ribeye came overcooked, a medium-well at best.  I\\'d take a whole star off for that, but the server was very quick to offer to replace the steak, and within 5 minutes I had a new, and perfectly cooked ribeye.  So only 1/2 star off.\\n\\nAnother 1/2 star off for the location/atmosphere.  The restaurant is 1 in a row of several in the back corner of the casino, and that isn\\'t great.  Surrounded by plexiglass, you have a bit of a feeling of being in a fishbowl and don\\'t really get that \"steakhouse\" atmosphere.\\n\\nOh, and the duck fat fries are outstanding, especially the  truffle oil ones!\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t go back, as it wasn\\'t so outstanding as to not give other places a try, but I would recommend it as a steak choice in the south strip.',\n",
       " \"StripSteak is located inside Mandalay Bay, and it's such a treat to have yummy food that is right downstairs.  This is kind of a splurge restaurant, both dollar-wise and calorie-wise, and I say calories be damned when in Vegas.  Just spend an extra hour in the pool the next day.\\n\\nI got the 18oz ribeye, and it was terrific.  I'm not sure if the kitchen is preparing the steaks with anything else besides salt & pepper, but my steaks at home never taste this good.  The thought of sauce never crosses your mind as your eat your steak.  The sides here are EXCELLENT.  We got the creamed corn, the potato gratin, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, and mushrooms.  I couldn't pick a favorite if you put a gun to my head, because they were all so dang good in their own way.  The creamed corn is slightly spicy, and the kernels are still firm when you take a bite, instead of all mushy.  The potato gratin is definitely more like a potato lasagna (as to aptly described by the famous Phil T), so don't even try to scoop it with the spoon they give you.  Grab a knife and go to down on that bad boy.\\n\\nThe service was good, and I never had to ask for more water, as they were constantly keeping an eye on us and stopping by.  Baby C was such a trooper & well-behaved during the meal, so we got the ice cream trio & the buttermilk citrus scoop was pretty amazing.  You're gonna land on somewhere around $100 per head, and they recommend reservations, which you can easily do by phone.\",\n",

It happens so no sweat there. However, At $58 per steak, nobody wants to eat alone, so we asked them for another plate and cut the one steak left and shared. Thought hey would have complimented the drinks or something for the hassle and accident.. They did NOTHING !! So disgusting and cheap of them. Will Never eat there again.',\n",

       " \"***StripSteak is a typical Michael Mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in Las Vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***\\n\\nThere is definitely a comforting consistency with Michael Mina restaurants regardless of the location. You are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a Michael Mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. Michael Mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so I am rarely surprised by his food.\\xa0\\n\\nMichael Mina in San Francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with San Francisco's best high-end cuisine. I remember finding Michael Mina in Las Vegas being good but nothing memorable. Their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe I need to give them another shot.\\xa0\\n\\nStripSteak in Mandalay Bay is a Michael Mina steakhouse. It has all the trademarks of a Michael Mina restaurant with Asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order.\\xa0Like Michael Mina's Arcadia in San Jose, StripSteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. Fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. The fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive.\\xa0\\n\\nI tried two of their beef cuts. The best was the Wagyu rib cap. This beef was very rich, juicy and tender. It did not match the best rib cap I've had, which was at Splendido in Toronto. That Canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. Still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender.\\xa0\\n\\nThe other steak was disappointing. It was a Prime bone-in ribeye. The steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. While it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick ribeyes you can get at a high-end steakhouse like Mastro's.\\xa0The steak was garnished with complimentary bone marrow. I also added grilled foie gras, which was fine but too pricey.\\n\\nFor sides, I had the pork belly fried rice that was mixed with carrots and peas. The fried rice was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of fried rice dishes I've had. I enjoyed the heat though I am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. I also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. The asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. The butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus.\\xa0\\n\\nFor dessert, I had the beignets with three sauces. The beignets were fairly good. They were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets I've had at restaurants like Village Pub and Spruce in the Bay Area as well as what I used to enjoy at the now closed Hatfield's in Los Angeles.\\xa0\\n\\nThe sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. There was a very good creme brûlée with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. There was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. The last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. The pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable.\\xa0\\n\\nService was good--friendly and polite. It is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants I've tried.\\xa0\\n\\nPrices are high, but it is Las Vegas. I think StripSteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.\\xa0\\n\\nAs mentioned, StripSteak is a loud restaurant. It is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. I did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of Las Vegas. I did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner.\\xa0\\n\\nStripSteak is a perfectly fine Las Vegas steakhouse. I think StripSteak really separates itself from other steakhouses I've been to across the country with its sides. The sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare. \\xa0The rib cap was very good while the ribeye was disappointing. If you are a big steak fan, I would recommend Carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but StripSteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in Las Vegas.\\n\\nLike most casinos on The Strip, parking at Mandalay Bay is free.\",\n",

       " \"Strip Steak is definitely one of the winners in the steakhouse category. The location worked great for me as a local because Mandalay Bay is close to the 215 and the actual restaurant isn't a long walk from the parking garage.\\n\\nThe duck fat fries with different sauces was a unique start to the meal and very good. The duck fat does give the fries a slightly better taste than the usual french fry. My filet mignon was awesome, very buttery and tender. Let's face it, the steak is the most important part of these restaurants and it exceeded expectations. My husband chose the wagyu and that was even better than the filet mignon. We shared the  pureed potato trio which was awesome. It was unique from the sides offered at other steakhouses and very tasty. One was lobster, one was horseradish and the other was sour cream. Of course we finished with dessert and that didn't disappoint.\",\n",

We got an assortment of sides that were delicious as well. The drinks were tasty and timely. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars is because of the shoddy wait service. HOWEVER, the rest of the staff was amazing. Especially Paige who after hearing about our ordeal, was more than willing to help us out.

I don\\'t know if we came on an off night or if the people reviewing are used to bad pasta, but after asking the waitress whether we should order the trio potato puree or the truffle mac she told us the truffle mac was the way to go. It was horrendously overcooked and extremely soft, I could definitely taste the truffle but it was over-peppered and that taste was overpowering. It was also very oily/greasy. I mentioned it being overcooked, and my friend and I ate literally one small spoonful each so over 90% of it was left in the container but the server didn\\'t mention anything else about it which I thought was poor service.\\n\\nDessert was excellent, I had the beignets with the butterscotch pudding.

We went with the tomatoes as our salad and frankly it just tasted like a plate of average tomatoes with a few bits of avocado thrown in. Definitely not worth it. I had the chicken ($39), which left me unimpressed, as it was rather bland, and my husband had the wagyu filet ($83) that while he very much enjoyed, couldn't say it was the best he'd ever had (though by far the most expensive). The potatoes au gratin are a must, probably the best thing they have besides that tiny square of instant bacon they serve. For dessert we went with the beignets ($24), again, nothing to write home about. The three dipping sauces were very thick, I wouldn't describe them as dipping sauces but rather desserts in their own right (creme brulee).

The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, so tender i could have cut it with a butter knife. My boyfriend had a wagyu strip steak that was incredible.',\n",

       " \"Grabbing a late dinner and looked forward to it. Must be good since expensive, right? Well I am disappointed. Ordered my filet medium and it came out more rare than medium. Had a side of broccolini which came out mildly warm at best. The cucumber martini was tasty as were the gratis fries. I will not be coming back although it wasn't horrible, it was not worth the large bill I'm about to pay. Go to Delmonicos- it was waaaay better!\",\n",
       " \"Very expensive (for the average joe like me) but the food was amazing. Had the filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. So tender but not bloody which I usually expect a bit from a rare steak. Amazing frois gras that melts in your mouth and mac and cheese to die for (if you like garlic especially). I also absolutely loved the lobster mashed potatoes. Our waitress was awesome as well and very patient as we took a good 20-30 minutes to figure out what we wanted to order between wine and food. The complimentary fries with dipping sauce may be the cherry on top of this dining experience. Only negative I can say is it was a bit loud and difficult to talk to those in your party especially a small party. Don't expect to get out of here for less than $300 with 2 people. Worth the splurge if you can swing it or atleast had a good night at the tables!\",\n",
       " \"This my favorite steakhouse. The duck fat fries are amazing. The different dipping sauces are great. I usually order the filet mignon. The Mac and cheese is one of the best Mac and cheeses ever. The kitchen is viewable so you can see the steaks being prepared. You can't go wrong with Stripsteak.\",\n",
       " 'I did not go to this place for dinner--just Happy Hour. I would definitely recommend it for happy hour because the wings and the garlic fries fried in duck fat was delicious! Beer and wine were not that bad either--less than $7 for the alcohol and less than $10 for the appetizers. Very good! Also, a shot of tequila for $5 is not bad for happy hour!',\n",
       " \"Took my girlfriend here for our anniversary. Service is amazing. Our server checked on us constantly, she was very knowledgable about steaks and all the menu items. They have a signature cocktail can't remember the exact name it was Apple something, but it was a great drink. Well mixed great flavor, to me it almost tasted like a green apple jolly rancher. I had the wagyu fillet mignon cooked medium and it was so flavorful and tender. This is a more upscale establishment, most people are dressed up. I don't think they would turn you away if you were a tourist in shorts but you can tell by the setting its a more dressy type place. The feel of the restaurant is very nice for dinner. It's a dim lighting with a small candle on the table. It's very open and transparent so you can see everything going on. Price is expensive, but the food and service and selection of steak and seafood truly warrants the higher prices. Oh and one last thing the duck fat fries are  in my top three fries I have ever had. This place earned its 5 star from me!!! We will be back. Also it does start getting  busy around 6-630.\",\n",

The daily special (30 day aged ribeye) was delicious, and the truffle Mac and cheese was incredible!\\nAlso, I must take a moment to single out our server Katie, as she did a phenomenal job. I have worked in restaurants for over 12 years. I also enjoy dining out, and she is easily one of the best servers I have ever encountered.  Thanks for a great meal!',\n",
       " \"How do you celebrate the wife's birthday the right way in Las Vegas? If you want her in a happy mood, you take here to Stripsteak.\\n\\nWe sat in the lounge this time to get more of an intimate feel (I guess the birthday girl was in a festive mood) and it did deliver with getting a bit out of the limelight of the main dining area. We sat right next to the bar area which may have lead to the consumption of alcohol at random.\\n\\nFor starters we were given the fries and yes the duck fat fries. Those for some reason just always have me quacking up a storm. The dipping sauces that accompany it do seem to add a special dose of flavor to it, but I was not a fan of the house made ketchup. It just tasted a bit more tomato like then I prefer.\\n\\nAs the main event I went with the filet mignon and partnered that with the Mac and cheese and spicy pork belly rice. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and melted away once again with every bite. The highlight for me though is the Mac and cheese. It is well worth 3 hours every time and highly recommended. The noodles were soft and none overcooked which is a rarity. My favorite was the cheese though. It is not overloaded and just the gooeyness in each bite sends your mouth into a tailspin.\\n\\nI spend so much on the main courses that I've never sampled the dessert, but next time for sure. I must find a new reason to come back right?\",\n",
       " \"SO GOOD!!!!!! Was in Vegas for a convention and a buddy of mine wanted to go here. I was a little reluctant because of the price but it was worth it. Prime steak, cooked to perfection. The sides were also great. We shared the spicy rice, brussel sprouts and potatoes. \\n\\nIt's not the easiest place to find since it's not in the casino, but once you do it stands out. We made a reservation online but didn't need it. The place was busy but not outrageous. Definitely not a place I will go to every time I visit Vegas (based only on price), but I will be back for good occasions with the fam and good friends.\",\n",
       " 'The scene: 18 of my closest friends and me for my birthday party.  September 2015\\n\\nThe menu: The \"Holstein\" pre-set dinner menu (with upgrades)\\n\\nWe all get it - Vegas is pricey.  But instead of paying $30-$50 for what amounts to fancy dorm food at a buffet, I decided to live it up a bit for my birthday.  Therefore, months of planning led to this epic dinner.\\n\\nFirst of all, given the sheer size of my party, I knew there would be some small issues.  Stripsteak does not have a private dining area, but they set up a nice table for my guests.  The ambiance was perfect for my type of outing - trendy, and certainly upscale without being stuffy, where you would have to worry about using the wrong fork and be without another for the rest of your night, as punishment.  I would probably give 4 stars as an individual rating for the \"value\" of the set-up vs. what it cost, but then there was...the food.\\n\\nAhh yes, the food.  What really matters.\\n\\nFirst of all, pretty much everything at Stripsteak is served with complimentary duck fat fries.  Deliciously crisp and decadent, and accompanied by 3 dipping sauces (but good enough to not require any accompaniment.)  Now here\\'s a little secret - still have a small ghetto streak in me where I like my fries served with my steak, so it was a little strange to have these as an appetizer, but surely a great way to start off the meal.\\n\\nPer their menu, my group had the choice of salad or a shrimp cocktail appetizer, entree of flat iron steak, chicken, or salmon (I have no idea how the non-steak items tasted.)  Upgrades to filet mignon or ribeye were available.  And given the decadence of my spending, an upgrade for sure was necessary.  (More on that below.)  Additionally, sides were served \"family style.\"  Broccolini, pureed potatoes of three flavors (sour cream and chive, lobster, and I can\\'t remember the other), and truffle mac and cheese.  The truffle mac and cheese was the highlight for many of my guests (the ones that didn\\'t order steak.)\\n\\nAhh yes, the steak.  Peruse their menu and you will see that Michael Mina doesn\\'t drive to a corner butcher to get his cuts.  With all respect to USDA grading of beef, this night required a little international flavor...in the form of...\\n\\nWorld Wide Wagyu.\\n\\nAnyone who has done steak research knows that Japanese Beef is luxurious but also a curiosity.  \"Kobe Sliders\" at your local bar and grill for $12 have more in common with an aging basketball player than they do true Kobe Beef.  Even cows that are designated \"Wagyu\" may not be imported from Japan.  So, this mini world tour consisted of three cuts of Wagyu (beef derived from a line of Japanese cows that are bred in other countries.)  These cuts:\\n\\nAmerican Wagyu Rib Cap - rib cap is the new trendy top cut of meat.  It\\'s generally the best couple ounces of your ribeye, made even better when it comes from a well-marbled wagyu cow.  This cut had a perfect sear and set all my umami sensors afire.\\n\\nAustralian Wagyu Short Rib - tender, fall-apart, as if it were braised.  (I didn\\'t check to see if it was actually braised short rib or not.)  \\n\\nFinally, real Japanese \"A5\" grade Wagyu Filet Mignon.  A5 is the highest grading that Wagyu can have in Japan, based on beef yield, color, and the all-important marbling score.  I wish I could have seen a photo of it before it was cooked, to visualize all the delicious marbling.  After cooking, it tasted like pure meat butter.  Delicious.\\n\\nAfter a meal like this, I\\'m not sure if I can ever go back to eating steaks even at fancy local steakhouses.  Of the three, I am declaring the American Wagyu RIb Cap the winner in an ever so slight margin over the Japanese A5 Filet (though, likely, just because it was Rib Cap).  The Australian came in third, but was still delicious.  Wagyu, you may have ruined me for life!  Thank you, Stripsteak, for introducing me to it and making me an addict.  \\n\\nThank you also for an incredible birthday with a ridiculously good meal.',\n",
       " 'It honestly kills me to give a Michael Mina restaurant a 3-star review -- I\\'ve been to many of his restaurants around the country, and am nearly always thrilled with the service and quality of the food.  Perhaps it was an off-night for the chef, but I left disappointed.\\n\\nLet me start with the good -- there were 16 of us in our party, and the accommodations were great (it\\'s generally tough to deal with a party that size), as was the service.  Also, the appetizers (tuna and hamachi poppers and fries) were very good.  As was the wedge salad.  And the side dishes were all great.\\n\\nThe disappointing part of the evening was the main course -- the steak.  I decided on the filet, which was a generous cut and looked great when presented.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked and dry.  The strange part is that -- with all the distraction of the large party -- several my friends and I didn\\'t realize until after the food was delivered that we were never asked how we\\'d like the steak prepared (to be fair, it sounds like about three-quarters of the party were asked...just not the several sitting near me).\\n\\nI\\'m not overly picking about preparation -- I would have been happy with medium-rare or medium -- but the steak came out on the medium-well side.  Worse yet, it was barely warm.  Perhaps a side effect of the large group, but I imagine we weren\\'t the first time the chef has dealt with large parties.  Good rule of thumb -- if the server forgets to ask how someone would like their steak cooked, ere on the medium-rare side, not the medium-well side.  In addition, the steak wasn\\'t seasoned much at all (those this could have been a side-effect of it being overcooked).  \\n\\nIn retrospect, I should have returned the meat, but by the time the server returned to check on us, many in the group were already halfway through the meal.  \\n\\nOverall, the experience was great, the service was great and the rest of the meal was great.  But, there\\'s no excuse for a bad steak at a place with \"steak\" in the name, and especially not at a Michael Mina restaurant.  I\\'m on the fence whether I\\'ll return, though the high ratings in general give me hope that my meal was an exception, not the rule.',\n",
       " \"Our meal was okay. The lobster tacos were fabulous. The wedge salad was good - like many others we've had. My husband had the ribeye with a half lobster tail and I had the brioche crusted bass. His steak was okay but I noticed he cut a lot away and pushed it to the side. My fish was tender and tasty but quite salty. The coffee was very good. I ordered a napoleon and was brought some sort of chocolate mousse or cheesecake dish. My husband ate most of it and I didn't complain because our waiter wasn't around much. The gentleman who filled our water, took away dishes, and filled my coffee was far more attentive. He was fantastic and I wish he had been our waiter.\\nSo, overall not a bad meal but not what I expected for the rather high price tag and I certainly didn't expect the waiter to be so inattentive and to bring something I didn't order. If they were out of napoleons, I would have expected him to explain then ask if I wanted something else instead of assuming I might like something else or that I wouldn't know the difference between pastry and cheesecake.\",\n",
       " 'The food is always tasty at Strip Steak.  However, the portions have gotten smaller and the prices have risen.\\n\\nThe free appetizers of french fries cooked in duck fat with exotic dipping sauces is a redeeming value.  But for a party of 7 they only brought 2 servings and then wanted to charge us for more.  If we were single diners, we each would have received one?  So why be so cheap?\\n\\nEVERYTHING is ala carte - main courses require sides to make them a complete meal.  This really jacks up the price.  \\nCaesar salad around $15 was small.  The $65 ahi tuna was ordered rare with seared outside - it was delivered cooked entirely through.  Small in size and cooked incorrectly.\\n\\nThe spinach side dish is awesome as are the sliced au gratin potatoes.\\n\\nOverall, I was disappointed compared to my visit a few years ago.',\n",
       " 'The food was decent.  The service, however, left a lot to be desired.  \\n\\nI tried the Wagyu Rib \"Cap\" on the recommendation of the server.  I originally wanted the Wagyu Rib Eye, but I decided to go with the recommendation instead.  \\n\\nThe Rib Cap was tender.  I asked to have it prepared rare-plus, but once again, the server recommended that I try the steak medium-rare instead.  I think I would have preferred it rare-plus as the medium-rare was a bit over cooked for my taste.  \\n\\nThe bone marrow was decent.  Nothing really to write home about there.  \\n\\nI came here for a work-related dinner.  I would have probably lowered my rating if I was forced to pay for this meal myself.',\n",

The sashimi was fresh and had some jalapeños for a little kick, and the bacon deal was just flat perfect.\\n\\nI had the Angus filet medium rare which was cooked to perfection, tender, well marbled...basically they took a perfect filet and made it better. \\n\\nBacktracking to the beginning of the experience at the bar, one of the bartenders told us that someone at our table had to get the rib cap. My brother in law ordered it and I was more than impressed. I\\'d never even heard of the cut and I\\'d like to think I\\'m pretty well versed in the beef world.\\n\\nOur sides were potatoes gratin and the mushrooms. Both sides were an 11/10.

       " \"After coming to Vegas for decades this place has really gone down hill.  It is clearly no longer one of best steak houses here. The wedge salad is a mere shadow of what it once used to be. Very small, very little bacon (used to be think full slices).  The steaks were EXTREMELY SALTY and slathered in butter. I mentioned this to the waiter as I didn't eat more than half. He seemed put-off by my comment.  A great steak needs very little seasoning.   Once you order wine they rush you to drink it - filling every 3 min. You don't fill wine glasses full of a $600 French Bordeaux.  The $33 yellowtail appetizer is a ridiculous portion size. It isn't even enough for 1 person. It's actually kind of a joke when you see it. I will offer the that complimentary French fries are good. But in all - won't repeat.\",\n",

See opening paragraph for my full assessment of this dish.\\n\\nSince this is a STEAK place, we figured we'd better order one. The **10 oz Prime Flat Iron** ($48) did not live up to expectations and was definitely not worth the cost. Even thought it was done medium, the meat was dry and lacked flavor.

       " \"Cow done right.\\n\\nYet another 2.5 years from my previous review.  Yet another dozen visits in that time.  StripSteak continues to evolve and prove its dominance as one of Vegas' top steakhouses.\\n\\nThis is a steakhouse so starting with the steaks.  Japanese A5 is back.  Although the brand is not specified, one slice into the heavily marbled beef (if ordered simply seared and raw on the inside) showcases its classic, deeply marbled, gentle beefy flavor, and melting sweet fat.  As good as it gets and at $35/oz, well worth it.  Tip:  Do not order more than 6oz.  The richness will fill you up very fast.\\n\\nUp next, the American Mishima wagyu.  Running A3 - A4 quality, these steaks are tender with a more pronounced beef flavor.  The fat is nowhere near as sweet as the A5 but still plenty good.  Opt for the rib cap if available.  It has the deepest beef flavor and is by far the most delicious.\\n\\nAn Australian wagyu offered as a tomahawk is very good.  To be shared (even if the bartender tries to tell you you can eat it by yourself - eyes bigger than stomach - epic fail).  A step down in tenderness but if beefy flavor is what you want, good balance.\\n\\nFinally the angus beef.  If you love American style beefy flavors, it's ahrd to pass on the UDSA prime flat iron.  A true butchers cut.  Packs mineral, beefy flavors.  Good chew and nicely integrated fat.\\n\\nAll steaks (except the A5) have a very good sear, cooked to temp, with a very even core.\\n\\nSauces and toppings if you must; foie gras butter is liquid crack.  Talk about richness with the distinct livery flavor of the foie.  Pairs beautifully with the bitterness from the wood burning grill.  Note:  do not add this to the Japanese A5 unless you want a heart attack.\\n\\nSides are meant to be shared.  Do not pass on the truffle mac and cheese, baked potato with bacon marmalade, or bone marrow topped with a matsutake chimichurri (the tiny bits of matsutake add an unmistakable umame finish).\\n\\nBouncing back to starters, three true standouts, the Mina classic foie with roasted pineapple, brioche, coconut milk and macadamia nuts, the braised oxtail French Onion soup, and the steakhouse staple, classic wagyu filet tartare.  All taste as good as they read.\\n\\nService is practiced and polished.  Very knowledgable.  Steakhouse friendly.\\n\\nThe wine program remains strong though somewhat lacking in vintage depth.  Many great choices.  Vegas resort pricing.\\n\\nRaising the bar once again for the top tier steakhouses in Vegas.\",\n",

I'm not a steak lover and didnt try any of the steaks that my husband, brother-in-law and father-in-law had, but the meat surely did look and smell very good!  Service was a tad slow because it was a Saturday night and business was super busy! Prices were reasonable and good, I meant, the bill had come out smaller than anticipated :P\",\n",

From the duck fat fries, you couldn't start better.  The oysters were outstanding.

Items like kusshi oysters, duck fat fries and short rib tacos. They also featured a wagyu beef burger for the meal.  I went with several $4 Coors light and the pair Short Rib Tacos.  The sous vide beef was so tender it just melted in your mouth.  Paired with pickled onions huge avocado slice, what I like best about these tacos was the tortillas. A soft corn wrapped around a crunchy like a double decker really have this taco some texture.  \\n\\nOverall great tasting food based on this sample. I will be back to try more tasty treats. Most likely I will return during happy hour because this place is beyond my budget otherwise.',\n",

And plus wouldn't really expecting it being bad service at all. \\n\\nWhen we ordered our food that is when I was disappointed. I ordered the Kobe steak (the one that was the most expensive on the menu) and the Bf ordered the ribeye steak, we had ordered the fried cauliflower, scallop potatoes, and the Mac and cheese. Cauliflower tasted horrible, it was suppose to be fried but it was mushy. The other two sides were good. The steaks were just okay. \\n\\nThe amount of money we paid for this dinner was not worth of coming back to. I was expecting something amazing with paying over $300 for two people...\",\n",

Everything we ordered was exceptional. \\n\\nWe started with the \"Instant Bacon\" as an appetizer... I had to try it because I was intrigued. While it was tiny, and not quite like your traditional bacon (it is pork belly, more so), it was so freakin good. It was crispy on the outside and sweet, but savory. I had no idea that they also bring out fries with dipping sauces that are amazing as well (the truffle aioli is on point!).\\n\\nI ordered the 18 oz ribeye. So good.. Cooked perfect with butter on top. The highlight of the meal may actually have been the potatoes au gratin though, believe it or not! They are covered in a rich, smokey Gouda cheese sauce. Unbelievable! It was a good sharing size as well. \\n\\nThe only downside that I could see was that it was pretty loud in there so you have to basically shout to carry on a decent convo (luckily I was with a fun group :)).',\n",

       " \"Since I can't give a 2.5, I won't do what most people do and round up. Maybe I don't have a sophisticated pallet, or maybe I didn't look like I would give up the tip to be seated in a location other than the bar when we were told there was a 45 minute wait for a table. Since we asked the Concierge for a recommendation and reservation information, we definitely would have had them make us reservations instead of the option of the 45 minute wait. We were in view of a group of tables that weren't occupied the entire time we were there and later realized that the restaurant was larger then we were aware of and there were numerous tables Unoccupied we wondered why we weren't seated at a table in the restaurant. We had just missed the happy hour apparently so the rush to get those prices shouldn't have been a problem. It was a Sunday evening last NFL playoff, CES and the Adult Film Awards were over. The hostesses didn't really bother to stop their personal conversation when we approached so it set the tone of what I felt was going to be a negative experience. Because we were seated in the worst seats in the open bar area, I had a first hand view of the open tables that no one was using the entire 1.5 to 2 hours we were at the restaurant. I also had the honor of facing the hostesses that apparently were employed to have conversations with each other until the big boss came along. But that is enough about them.\\nThe waitress was attentive gave suggestions and checked in often as well as other staff of the restaurant. Now the restaurant is not some place you would bring your family because it is quite pricey. Since I was being treated I didn't feel that I should order steak from the steak house. Everything is alacart, so expect to spend upward of $100 per person. My companion is a foodie. Likes new and different things. She ordered the pork belly and potatoes scalloped. I ordered beet salad and lobster taco. Now this was supposed to be a fine dining experience (pinky raised), but I have to say not accommodating for menu item adjustments. I asked for pecans with my beet salad. I may have gotten two lonely perfectly positioned pecans. I also realized why there was a pause when I requested additional dressing options. Well my appetizer selection was not a substitute for a meal. The lobster taco had more pico than lobster. I could count the meniscal pieces of lobster. It needed salt and something acidic.  Just a precautionary measure of advice. Do not go here if you are hungry portions are small, small, small. My daughter loved her pork belly. It was deceiving lite, crispy and not as greasy as I expected. The potatoes were alright. The best part of the meal were the French fries that we tried to guess what the seasonings were as well as the sauces. I agree that the catsup was my least favorite. So to the hostesses I say don't judge a customer by its cover. You did pass up a good tip by not seating us. Over all the rating is for OK food, served well but judgmental hostesses.\",\n",

Over a hundred bucks, but can easily feed two people. So amazingly tender, and perfectly cooked. Nicely charred exterior, with bloody red medium red interior. Crust was seasoned perfectly, and the wagyu marbling really came through in the steak's tenderness and flavor. Wow.\\n\\nMy Caesar salad was good, although it did not stand out in any real way. The same goes for the sides. Very good, but not terribly memorable. What I really remember (and still have dreams about) is that wagyu steak. My goodness. I will definitely have to get that again the next time I am in Las Vegas.\",\n",
       " \"Went here just to try the duck fat fries everyone was talking about. They were delicious and the herb garlic put them over the edge.  Had the Wagu tartar as a starter, which was delicious and melts in your mouth. Followed that with the duck breast, it was cooked perfect and didn't have the oily texture it has a tendency to have. I was impressed by this place and it was one of the best meals I've had in a while.\",\n",

I can say I found that here. \\n\\nI came here with a group for dinner without reservations. They were booked solid but thought they may have a cancellation so called the party to see if they could release the table for us. This level of service continued all night. \\n\\nAfter being stayed we were brought our drinks with plenty of recommendations from our waitress. This was soon followed by complimentary French fries, fried in duck fat. On top of that they were seasoned with old Bay, black truffle or an herb blend. Best fries ever. \\n\\nI next had a BLT lettuce wedge. It came with thick cut bacon and large chunks of blue cheese. It was good but at the end of the day it was a chunk of lettuce for $18. \\n\\nThe real star was the steak, as it should be. I got the house specialty, the Wagyu Rib Cap cooked to a chef recommended and perfect medium rare. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The flavor was off the charts and the Fois gras butter just took the whole thing to another level. I can't remember ever having a better steak. It was really pricy, $89, but worth the cost for sure. \\n\\nStripsteak  is a very expensive meal, but if you have the money, you will not be disappointed by the food or the service.\",\n",
       " 'We had a dinner reservation and were sat in the lounge. The server was very knowledgable but the attire was more strip club than modern steak.

The ribeye was really good. Grill to exact request it was smooth and full of flavor. The Ceasar wasn't that great. When we ordered ours without anchovies it came with it anyway. What threw me a bit was the total lack of craft beer selection. Several pages of fantastic wines but no draft craft beer selection. Only bottles and sub par beer selection at that. Basically not the type of beer you want to complement a five star steak with. A little shocked actually. So one star for not what we ordered and one star for no craft beer.\",\n",

       " 'Steak was good but the sides just mediocre.  The cost was really expensive for not much value.  The wait was extremely long, even with reservations, and took over an hour to get our food once seated.  With so many options in Vegas your money is better spent at another restaurant.',\n",

There are only a few places in the country that offer it on their menu, and nobody makes it as well as they do here. I have eaten at Strip Steak 8 or 10 times, and from the appetizer to the dessert the food has always exceeded my expectations.

Our group, each having two cocktails each, sides and steak had about a $600 meal total for 4 people. As long as you know this you should enjoy the experience. \\n\\nThe duck fries were phenomenal, the tar tar worth ordering and the mac and cheese side was also delicious!\\n\\nWe ordered the prime rib eye (highly recommend) and the filet mignon. Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned to the point where somehow I ate like a pound of cow and my mouth was exploding with flavor. \\n\\nAmbiance is just ok in my opinion given its location in a strip area of Mandalay. Nothing too out of the ordinary and I didn't really find the setting too intimate. \\n\\nServer was quirky and somewhat attentive.

       " 'Had dinner at Stripsteak last night with 10 international customers. The food was terrible. Without doubt the worst steak I have had from a place calling itself a premium steak house. My $62 prime bone in NY strip steak was fatty and tough. Cooked over a wood grill my steak arrived with a layer of soot tasting like burnt wood. 3 out of 10 steaks had to be sent back to the chef to cook as requested. We had a 7:15pm reservation and were served at 9:15pm. The place was not that crowded. When I explained to the manager how bad my steak tasted and showed her the pieces of fat on my plate, she said, \"I\\'ll have to check with our chef, maybe we got a bad batch of steaks\". Hard to find a bottle of wine under $100 but there were plenty of bottles over $300.\\nI felt bad for the wait staff because they were very pleasant and did everything they could to try and turn a terrible dinner into a decent evening. All this bad food for only $1600. Michael Mina really disappointed me with his first steakhouse.',\n",

The menu in general is a typical high-quality steakhouse and fitting to the tasteful décor that lets you remember where it is you are dining.\\n\\nThe true star though of this restaurant, in my opinion, is the complimentary trio of duck fat fries.

       " \"Big disappointment. Lovely place, noisy (we could barely talk at times), great service. My friend and I both had the Wagyu Filet for $79 each--the steak was very tender but was strangely under seasoned. And I've had grass fed steaks with better, and more flavor. Perhaps they expected you to invest another $6 in a sauce (a variety offered) but this doesn't provide a great wine pairing...\\n\\nAll the salt missing from the steak, and then some, was in the sides. We have the brussels sprouts (which were perfectly cooked which is rare) but too salty with the meat. And the scalloped potatoes. Both too salty!!! \\n\\nI won't be back.\",\n",
       " 'Let me start this with, i didn\\'t pay for this meal. I\\'ve always noticed that if i am on the fence about a meal being good or not, it comes down to the value for me... \"was it worth it?\"\\n\\nI came to StripSteak for a business function and a group of approximately 20 different people. The dining space is slightly upscale, with a welcoming atmosphere, nice lighting, and not ridiculously loud music. Service was tentative and friendly was worked our group well without hiccups. The food was from a fixed menu like usual with larger groups, choosing a starter, and your entree from 2-3 choices. I had a prawn starter that came with 3 large prawns and a sauce on the plate (i don\\'t see this on regular menu). Fresh, good, and perfect starter for a much heavier beef entree to come very soon. My steak choices were of the 16 oz. Rib eye or 10 oz. Filet and i opted for the filet as i wasn\\'t overly hungry and the smaller cut would be perfect. The meat was pleasantly prepared consistent throughout the table and was of quality you would expect at a place like StripSteak. Sides that were offered were Broccolini and Mashed Potatoes, the Broccolini was quite tasty and i didnt try the Potatoes but im sure they were good as well given the feedback at the table. All in all it was a good meal, actually the best i had over the 4 day event being in town and having a meal each night at a new place. You would expect that when you come to a place such as StripSteak, with the pricing that your meal should always be a thumbs up but its not the case. The same time last year a similar group went to Carnevino, and the quality of the food was not up to par as i am guessing it has to do with maybe the large group and fixed menu. So if your looking for a quality spot that will handle your corporate event, with good food, solid service, and a positive impression StripSteak ranks up there for me.',\n",

Thank you to Christopher, the bartender who made my experience memorable. My friend and I started with the foie gras. It was such a decadent piece, a little more on the sweet side since it was served with a grilled pineapple. We then decided to order their Filet Carpaccio with the french fires served 3 ways.

Even though I politely pointed this out to our server, she offered nothing besides a cursory apology. Even the drinks were terrible - there was ice in my martini, and the bottle of (red) wine we ordered with dinner came out super cold.

We had a party of 5 & took our foodie friends. There may have been tears of joy shed & it was THE PERFECT last meal of our trip.\\n\\nFor apps, we did crispy duck rolls, pork belly (instant bacon on the menu) & crab legs. The duck was great, but the latter two were so phenomenal it made a great app underwhelming. As always, the complimentary duck fat fries were a big hit.\\n\\nThree of us had scallops for our entrees; they were perfection. One had the flat iron steak; again, perfect w/no complaints. But the absolute stars of the culinary show were the rib cap & the bone marrow side. Oh. My. God. Rich, delicious, heaven! \\n\\nOther sides we ordered were pork belly fried rice, brussels sprouts & gratin potatoes. All had subtle, perfectly harmonized flavors. Perhaps one thing I personally did not care for was the preparation on the brussel spouts; they were rather soft (but GREAT flavor) & I prefer mine roasted & a little charred & crispy. \\n\\nWe shared beignets for dessert (7 pieces w/creme brûlée, chocolate & well-aged-scotch butterscotch sauces) they were perfect as we were all stuffed but couldn't pass up a sweet bite ending.

       " 'Awesome place! Steak was wonderfully prepared, mac and cheese was so rich and creamy. A restaurant meal you will always remember as being one of the best you have ever had.',\n",
       " \"I've been to many steak houses in my time from LA to the greats of Chicago and this is my favorite of all.  I've tried several of different cuts here but the best for the money is the 40oz tomahawk cut.  Perfectly cooked and well seasoned the steak is great but the huge standouts are the sides.\\n\\nThey start you off with some of the best fries and dipping sauces you will ever have.  All sides are large enough to share and could not be any better.  I like to get the Truffled Mac and Cheese along with the potatoes au gratin.  No Vegas trip is complete without a stop by Strip Steak!\",\n",
       " \"we were back because it was really worth it and the Service was Good. Everything in here is great! but tonight was special and I wanted to thank The manager for allowing us to try their dry aged rib eye steak even thought it was not yet available because it's still need to be dried for 60 days. Anyways, Yesterday we wondered why is the dry aged not available or it's not in the menu. Because of the drying process was not yet complete which is 60days but The manager allowed us to grab one and we are thankful for it. The steak we got is 45 days dried aged Rib eye steak. Medium rare if possible but my wife wanted Medium. Drinks here are great as well. they have almost every wine you could think of. that's it. Thank you!\",\n",
       " \"I've been here twice now. First time I had seafood and it was good. My most recent trip I had their creekstone farms bone in ribeye NY and it was amazing. Very impressed with the flavor. Kiela and Karent were great hostess and took care of us. The corn that's seasonal is delicious and the lobster potatoes were great.\",\n",
       " \"If you read my reviews you can tell I'm a fan of Donavan's Steak House in San Diego. \\nThis place surpassed them. Donavan's is awesome don't get me wrong, but this place is spectacular. \\n\\nThere's nothing here that was less then perfect. \\n\\nAppetizers awesome, bone in ribeye superb, potatoes were great. I can't say enough about this place. \\n\\nThe service was spot on, our waitress attentIve and friendly.\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed the summer tasting menu for $85.00 (summer of 2015 - I accidentally didn't finish the review when we went.) Every course was delicious and was presented well. The seating in the back of the restaurant with the cozy mini arm chairs was very comfortable as well. Our server was very kind and attentive.\",\n",

       " \"This place hits the culinary jackpot for Vegas!\\nMade reservations & took the family for a nice Memorial Day dinner. We were met by the manager Paige & seated promptly. Not only does this restaurant have fantastic food-it has fantastic service. Paige & our server Jelena were superb. They made great suggestions and helped pick something out that could be customized for my little guy too! The food all came out quickly:\\nDuck fat fries in truffle, rosemary Parmesan, and sea salt.....wow-truffle fries! Michael Mina-you had me at truffle....Think I've died & gone to heaven\\nSeafood tower appetizer-lobster, crab, shrimp on ice with spicy cocktail sauce & Tabasco. Can't believe that we are really in the middle of the desert-the seafood is that fresh\\nMain course: Filet Minon, sautéed mushrooms, and Mac & cheese. Two words-pure perfection....filet that melts in your mouth and the wood grilled flavor so good that you don't even need ANY kind of sauce. Not a single ounce of fat.....sigh......\\nLastly, was the campfire s'mores. Happy faces all around!\\nA huge thank you to the manager Paige & server Jelena for a wonderful experience-We will definitely be back!!!!!!\",\n",
       " \"Quite possibly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I don't believe many of these lower rated reviews as our whole dining experience was top notch. The food was spectacular.  Will we be back? Absolutely! Was it expensive? Yes, but amazing food, great drinks and wonderful service comes with a price(that we'd gladly pay again!).  So what we ordered: Scottish Salmon, Filet, BLT Wedge and Gratin Potatoes. We would've had dessert but we were stuffed after our meals. All of our food was prepared to perfection!  Living in Seattle, we're treated to the best salmon. The salmon served at Stripsteak is right up there. My husband loved his filet which was delicious.  The Gratin with smoked Gouda was decadent. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the Gouda was so creamy and rich. The BLT Wedge was probably my favorite part of the meal. The bacon was amazing - crisp but juicy and the right amount of smoke. They also started is off with a trio of fries and dipping sauces which were a very pleasant and tasty surprise! And then they also sent us home with a treat of gourmet popcorn. The drinks were terrific too - I tried the cucumber martini which was lightly sweet and refreshing.  Our server Brian was fantastic. The service he provided was second to none. You can tell he loves his job and the restaurant which isn't all too common these days. Thank you for the wonderful dinner - we'll be back!\",\n",
       " 'It was my friends birthday and his choice of restaurants and his choice was Strip Steak. I have been to almost all Steak joints in Las Vegas but have never been to Strip Steak and was looking forward to trying it.\\nAs soon as you sit down they bring you three varieties of  french fries and three great dipping sauces.\\nWe ordered the Instant Bacon and Duck egg rolls, the bacon was too fatty for my liking, but the eggs rolls were a home rum.\\nMy friend raved how great the Wagyu steak was, it was tender and full of flavor, it was expensive, but very good.\\nThe lobster tacos were amazing.\\nThe star of the night was there special fried rice, I know fried rice in a steak restaurant, it does not go, WRONG, there fried rice is good it works anywhere.\\nThere gratin potatoes with smoked gouda was so rich but so good.\\nThe service was top notch, now i know why he pick Strip Steak to celebrate his birthday.',\n",
       " \"My date and I both agreed that it could very well be the best filet we have ever had and we've had them all here in Vegas. Simply amazing. The foie gras was impeccable, beignets for dessert were as good as du Monde in New Orleans and the creme brûlée custard was an excellent touch. Just found our new regular steakhouse.\",\n",
       " \"Absolutely phenomenal. Can't say enough about this place. A group of us had reservations for here and were very pleased.  Four of us split the 48 oz rib eye which was out of this world good. Very juicy and filled with flavor. All the side dishes were great and the best compliment appetizer was the Duck Fat Fries!!! These were really really delicious.  Keep in mind this is Vegas and is a steak house within a casino, you are going to pay a bit. Well worth the splurge.\",\n",
       " 'Nice place .. the steak was nice but not hot enough .. if I order a $95.00 steak I want it hot .. not lukewarm... Drink were good. Over all had a good time .. will not be back ...',\n",
       " 'Like the atmosphere. No need to make a reservation as they sat us instantly at around 9 pm on a thursday. Got the 10 oz filet and it tasted just great!!',\n",
       " 'You just have to eat here. Everything is delicious. We always come here when in town. The instant bacon is a must as a starter.',\n",
       " 'Outstanding food and service - hugely enjoyable.  You paid every penny for what you received, and were happy to do so in the end.  Outstanding.',\n",
       " \"Great meal with a casual vibe.  Very happy group!  \\n\\nOur party of six enjoyed everything that we ate, from the amazing steaks to the great appetizers and fantastic family style sides (don't miss the mushrooms, wowee!).  So much food that a beignet sampler for dessert couldn't even be finished between the six of us but it was still worth a taste!  The waitress was friendly and the place was nice.  It is expensive since it appears a little more casual than it actually is, but the food makes up for it.  You won't be disappointed eating here!\",\n",
       " \"Just ate here again... worthy of an updated review because the food is so damn good and I love the service. They continue to focus on fresh and seasonal ingredients, most evidenced by their epic creamed corn. I ordered the chicken again - new recipe and was almost as good as my first visit. Flavor was even better but wasn't quite as moist - I'm nitpicking here!\\nAlso love all the little freebies like their french fries and candy corn for dessert, nice little touches that certainly differentiate themselves as being a customer centric restaurant.\\nMuch thanks to Whitney and Ashley for making me feel welcome - see you next month!\",\n",
       " \"I cannot say enough good things about this place. I enjoyed the bone marrow, a filet and fries.\\n\\nEverything was prepared perfectly. The server was polished and professional.\\n\\nIt was a bit loud but that's a personal thing and no reflection on the restaurant.\\n\\nI throughly enjoyed my visit.\",\n",
       " \"It's hit or miss at this restaurant. I've dined here twice this week while in Vegas on business, eating at the bar. The first night my $61 medium rare filet mignon was perfect, and the half order of mushrooms ($8) was fantastic. The second night, my $63 ribeye was not nearly as flavorful as a ribeye should be, and instead of preparing it medium rare, it was light pink and a definite medium, leaning toward medium well. I was starving so I didn't alert the bartender until he came by a few minutes later. I didn't want a new steak at that point so I just paid for it anyway. Premium steakhouses need to be able to provide a flavorful cut of meat and cook it as ordered. I was seriously disappointed. I also ordered a half order of asparagus with a cucumber yogurt sauce as a side and it was okay but needed salt. And I rarely feel the need to add salt to a restaurant dish.\",\n",
       " \"Will never go back! Spent a weekend in Vegas with my husband for our anniversary and went here for dinner. I decided to splurge and get the wagyu beef filet and it was horrible! The meat was extremely fatty, not flavorful and definitely not worth the money. To top it off I told our waitress and she brought the manager over. I then told the manager and she said she was so sorry and did absolutely nothing when our bill came. ( Even recommended getting the beignets dessert to us and never even thought to comp it!) I understand its a business and you need to make money but if you want people to come back or not spread negative about your business you need to at least act like you care about the customer. Not to mention this is Vegas, I would expect to get what I pay for!! Let's just say my night was ruined after eating here. I thought an anniversary dinner here would be special and it was so not. We spent way too much money and I didn't even enjoy my meal. \\n\\n\\nI will definitely go to another steakhouse when I go back to Vegas!!\",\n",
       " 'We visited StripSteak inside the Mandalay Bay for 2 times. You need to triy the Instant Bacon - this is one of the best things i ever tasted. \\n\\nHad the Wagyu Filet Mignon - it just melts away in your mouth. The truffled Mac&Cheese and the red wine champignons were perfect compagnions!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is a little too \"cold\" IMO - but the great food leads me to overlook this ;-)']"
